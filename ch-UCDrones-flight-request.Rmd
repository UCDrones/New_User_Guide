# Submitting a Flight Request

An individual Flight Request comprises of one or more UAS flights on a single day. Each Flight Request is reviewed individually, typically to address local issues such as campus safety, scheduling or privacy concerns.

**Example Individual Flight Requests**

-	Any site that the field manager requires prior approval for scheduling or wildlife considerations
-	Athletic or recreational fields that require scheduling
-	On-campus public areas without additional mitigation protocols or safety hazard analysis.
-	Special operations â€“ flying at night, flying above 400 ft AGL, etc

## Non-Project vs Project Flight

Both Projects and Non-Projects use the same Flight Request Form.  A Flight Request for a Project must be selected from the Project Page - either the Manage Projects Page and select 'Add Flight' (Figure \@ref(fig:UCDrones-project-flight-1)) or from the individual Project page and select 'Add Flight' under the header (\@ref(fig:UCDrones-project-flight-2)).

```{r UCDrones-project-flight-1, fig.cap='UC Drones Manage Projects', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/UCDrones_manage_project.jpg')
```

```{r UCDrones-project-flight-2, fig.cap='UC Drones Project Management', out.width='85%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/UCDrones_project_addflight.jpg')
```

**Differences**

- A Flight Request for a Project is automatically approved upon submission
- A Flight Request for a Project is autofilled with the Project information
    - Only a handful of fields may be changed or completed
