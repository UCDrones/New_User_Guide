# Do I need an FAA License? {#ch-license}

When operating a drone within the US, there are two different options for regulations: Part 107 Small UAS regulations or the Exception for Limited Recreational Use.  By default, UAS operations fall under Part 107 Small UAS regulations, unless you can meet the requirements for the exception for Recreational Use.  Part 107 requires that all pilots have a Remote Pilot Certificate with an sUAS rating, more commonly known as a 'Drone License,' whereas Recreational Use requires a TRUST certificate.

As of June 2021, all drone pilots must have either:
1. Remote Pilot Certificate (Drone License)
2. TRUST Certificate

Many researchers opt to get a Drone License for their research needs, but a Drone License does cost $150 and will take some time to study and prepare for.  With the updates introduced in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254), there are more exceptions available in which you may not need to obtain the license.

The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST) certificate is a new requirement for all drone pilots without a Drone License.  The TRUST certificate is free for everyone, can be done online and takes 20-30 minutes to complete the training. You can obtain your TRUST certificate by completing the drone training at any of websites listed on the FAA's website here: https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/knowledge_test_updates/

> This page is for the Federal Aviation Administration licensing requirements for UAS use.  UC Policy will still require a flight request and post flight reporting, regardless of FAA licensing requirements. More information on the UC policy can be found in Chapter .


## What is the difference?

Under Part 107 
 
- Drone License required
- Any purpose
- 'Fly only when it is safe'
- May request special permissions
  - Above FAA Facility Map altitudes
  - Over People, BVLOS, More than 1 drone at a time
  
Under Recreational Exception

- TRUST certificate
- Recreation or Approved Academic Activities
- 'Fly only in safe locations'
- No allowances for advanced operations

## When are you Exempt from a drone license

You may not need a drone license if your flight operations can fit under the stipulations listed for 'recreational' activities **and** your flight operations are related to 

- Coursework
- Instruction of students
- Academic or research related uses of unmanned aircraft systems that have been approved by the institution
- Activities undertaken by the institution as part of research projects
- Other academic activities approved by the institution

## What are the stipulations for 'Recreational' and approved 'Academic' activities?

Recreational flight operations, despite what you see on YouTube, have strict requirements:

- Only fly below 400 ft
- Must stay within Visual Line of Sight
- Must fly only in safe areas and no closer than 25 ft to any individuals
- Must use an established safety line to separate all operations from spectators and bystanders
- Must get FAA authorization to fly in Controlled Airspace (Class B, Class C, Class D and surface Class E)
- Never fly over any person or moving vehicle
- Never interfere with any manned aircraft or emergency response activity
- Never fly under the influence of drugs or alcohol
- Never operate in a careless or reckless manner

This is in addition to existing UAS operating restrictions under 14 CFR 107:

- No operating from a moving vehicle
- No operating more than one vehicle at a time
- No operating faster than 100 mph
- No operating when the weather visibility is less than 3 miles
- No operating closer than 500 ft below a cloud, or within 2000 ft horizontally from a cloud or fog layer

## Other Situations
There are other conditions that may require a closer evaluation, including whether you're a US citizen or if you plan on flying internationally.  If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to [UASsafety@ucmerced.edu](mailto:UASsafety@ucmerced.edu) for a consultation. 

Other scenarios that may require a closer look 

- Performing a demonstration
- Not a US citizen
- Flying above 400 ft AGL
- Flying in fog or with limited visibility
- Flying at night
- Flying internationally

## Frequently Asked Questions

**When doing an academic activity, which set of regulations is better?**

There are advantages and disadvantages to both scenarios.  In many cases, the new ‘Recreational Operations’ may be the fastest path forward for simple, rural flight operations. At the current time, academic UAS activities that plan on flying in certain controlled airspace areas, over occupied structures, within 25 ft of another person, or outside of a reasonably controlled flying site, should proceed with 14 CFR 107 regulations.

**What does it mean to get approval from the FAA to operate within controlled airspace?**

The FAA is mandating that all controlled airspace access requests for recreational operations be routed through the Low Altitude Authorization Notification Capability system (LAANC) and not by calling the local airport tower.  The LAANC system can provide instantaneous authorization via a 3rd party application such as Airmap, KittyHawk, or UASideKick for flight requests below a certain altitude depending on your location.

**I am planning to fly over a research site that is access controlled and the airspace is uncontrolled, do I need a Drone License?**

Typically not.  This common scenario will typically meet the necessary site requirements for Recreational Operations.

**I am planning to fly along the beach to monitor coastal erosion, do I need a Drone License?**

Unless the beach is to be closed to the public, this scenario will likely require a Drone License.

**I am planning on flying in the campus quad to test a flight controller, do I need a Drone License?**

If the airspace is uncontrolled (Class G), and the area within the campus is sufficiently cleared and closed to non-participants, then you do not need a Drone License and can get the TRUST certificate.  However, there are some parts of some of the UC campuses that are in controlled airspace where a Drone License is required.  Please check with your Campus Drone Point of Contact for more information.

**I do not have a Drone License, can I do a coursework assignment on the use of drones in building inspections with a TRUST certificate?**

You may be able to do some flying with only a TRUST certificate, however, you will not be allowed to fly over a building and must stay at least 25 ft from all non-participants, which may limit your ability to conduct effective analysis.  

**I am a graduate student Teaching Assistant and I would like to teach my students how to fly a drone?  Do I need a license? Do the students need a license?**

If the site is sufficiently cleared and closed to non-participants, than everyone may have a chance to learn how to fly a drone with only a TRUST certificate and any instructor may only have a TRUST certificate.  However, additional safety precautions may be necessary and as an instructor, you will be responsible for ensuring the safety of the students and the site.
