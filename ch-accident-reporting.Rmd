Whether you're a new or experienced pilot, accidents can happen. In the event that you crash your drone you need to remember to stay cool and carefully survey the damage that was caused. 

If your accident causes either:

- Serious injury (injury that requires hospitalization) or loss of consciousness; or
- More than $500 worth of damage (excluding the drone)

then you are required to file a report with the FAA within 10 days of the accident.


## How to file an accident report

You can report an accident to the FAA using a few different methods. Method 1 is to submit your report through the FAA's Drone Zone page.

Logging into your account and scrolling to the bottom of your dashboard you will find a "Part 107 Accident Reports" box where you can then submit your accident report. The reporting form requires you to fill out both plot information and your flight operation details.
