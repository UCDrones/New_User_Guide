Don't Panic! Whether you're a new or experienced pilot, accidents can happen. In the event that you crash your drone you need to remember to stay cool and carefully survey the damage that was caused. A quick damage survey would break down as follows: 

1. Make sure everyone is safe and that there were no injuries before proceeding. 
2. Approach and inspect crash site. Are the damages 
3. Make notes of possible damages and take pictures of site. 
4. Closely inspect your UAV to ensure status.
5. IF the crash injured an individual or severely damaged the aircraft and possibly caused over $500 in damages:
  - please mark the appropriate box on your post-flight report and send notes and images taken to the Center of Excellence. .
6. IF after careful inspection there were no injuries or damages AND the drone is deemed flyable may you take back to the skies.  

If your accident causes either:

- Serious injury (injury that requires hospitalization) or loss of consciousness; or
- More than $500 worth of damage (excluding the drone)

then you are required to file a report with the FAA within 10 days of the accident.
