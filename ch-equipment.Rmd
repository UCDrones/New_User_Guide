## What Drone should I get?

If you're not sure what drone to get and you don't want to spend a huge amount of money on a DJI Matrice 300, here are some potential options.

### Drones for Mapping

**Phantom 4 Series** - The DJI Phantom 4 series is an older, but still viable option for most drone mapping projects.  With a 25 minute flight time and a mechanical shutter, it's capable of small mapping missions up to 10 acres at a time.  Great for small projects and flight training. Unfortunately, this drone is no longer being produced and is getting harder to find.  

**Mavic 2 Pro** – They stopped selling this last year with the release of the Mavic 3, but the Mavic 2 Pro is compatible with all major mapping software and has a decent enough camera system to get good results.  If you can find one on Amazon or elsewhere, it’s worth picking up.  While it doesn't have a mechanical shutter, it's still a great platform for basic mapping projects (RGB only).

**Mavic 2 Zoom** – Similar to the Mavic 2 Pro, but the camera isn’t as widely compatible.  It’ll work with Drone Deploy, but not with Pix4DCapture. Much better as a flight trainer than for completing missions.

**Mavic Air 2** – Nice compact drone for regular flying, but also not as widely available since the release of its successor Mavic Air 2S. Is compatible with Drone Deploy with iOS, but nothing else.

**Mavic Air 2S** – You can still find this one available, but stock is dwindling as DJI prepares for the launch of the Mavic Air 3.  DroneDeploy compatibility is in BETA testing - this might be the last entry level DJI drone to be compatible with mapping software such as Drone Deploy.

**Skydio 2+** - The only non-DJI drone compatible with DroneDeploy.  It's smaller than a Mavic, and the camera is not as high quality, but as DJI moves away from compatibility with mapping software, it's worth checking out for basic/simple flight missions.

**Autel Robotics EVO II** - Another rare non-DJI drone. It's a worthy Mavic competitor and unlike the DJI drones, has mapping software functionality built-in.  A little pricier, but worth exploring.

### Drones for Videos

**Mavic 3** - The DJI Mavic 3 is a great drone. It boasts a 45 minute flight time, a great camera and almost all the features you could want from a drone - except its not compatible with mapping software.  If you're just doing cinematography, its a good albeit pricey option at \$2k (\$2.8k with the extra battery combo pack).

**Mini 2/3** - The DJI Mini series are great, affordable and high-quality small drones.  At only 249g, it packs a lot a capability into a tiny platform. It's great as a flight trainer and good enough for some media use.  

**DJI Avata** - This is DJI's first entry into the FPV world, but it's not for everyone.  It's designed for high-speed acrobatics, so it's not a great drone for newcomers as it handles different than other DJI drones. But if you're looking to add some up-close action shots, its a good option.

### Drones to Avoid

**Off-Brand Drones** - DJI has the largest marketshare for drones, but its not unwarranted.  Any drone you can find on Amazon or at Costco, BestBuy or Target that isn't a DJI, is likely to under-perform. Drone companies to avoid - Holy Stone, DEERC, ORKNELY, etc 

**Tello** - The Ryze Tellos have a partnership with DJI, but are not DJI drones and it shows.  With poor flight handling and a very limited range, these \$100 drones should only be used indoors and only for specific STEM curriculum activities - they're not useful as a tool or for flight training.

## Multi-Spectral Data Collection

Multi-spectral data is a common need for many utilizing drones in agricultural or environmental research. But in order to get that data, you'll need to use a specialized camera that is capable of capturing images in multiple spectral bands. This can include visible light, near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands. The data obtained from these cameras can then be used to create NDVI and other indices, which can be used to analyze and interpret the health and condition of vegetation.

Here are the general steps to obtain multispectral data from a drone:

1. Choose the right drone: The first step is to select a drone that is equipped with a multispectral camera or one that can be outfitted with a multispectral sensor.

2. Plan your flight: It is important to plan your flight path in advance, taking into account the area of interest and the desired resolution of the data. The flight path should be carefully planned to ensure that the camera captures images of the entire area of interest.

3. Collect the data: Once you have planned your flight, you can fly your drone and collect the data. Make sure to follow all safety guidelines and regulations when flying.

4. Process the data: After the flight, the data needs to be processed and analyzed. This typically involves converting the raw images into georeferenced, orthorectified images, and then creating NDVI and other indices.

5. Analyze the data: Once the data is processed, it can be analyzed to extract information about the health and condition of vegetation. This can be done using software tools specifically designed for NDVI analysis.

It's important to note that multi-spectral data collection is a complex task that requires specialized equipment, software and expertise. We have some recommendations below, but feel free to reach out to us for a consultation.

### Multi-Spectral Cameras

**RedEdge-P** - The [RedEdge-P](https://ageagle.com/drone-sensors/rededge-p/) is the newest generation of high-resolution multispectral cameras from AgEagle (formerly Micasense).  It has six channels: Blue (475 nm), Green (560 nm), Red (668 nm), RedEdge (717 nm), NIR (842 nm) and a Panchromatic channel (450nm - 900nm). This allows for pan-sharpened output resultions of 2cm.  Though a bit pricey at $8k, it's a great all-around multispectral solution and is compatible with DJI Matrice 300 and other larger drones.

**Altum-PT** - The [Altum-PT](https://ageagle.com/drone-sensors/altum-pt/) is a 3-in-1 solution, capable of RGB, NIR and Thermal data collection.  With a slightly higher resolution for RGB/NIR than the RedEdge-P and a faster capture rate, it's a step up with a heft pricy tag at $15k. Compatible with the DJI Matrice 300 and other larger drones.

**MAPIR Survey 3** - A low-cost solution at $700, the [Survey 3](https://www.mapir.camera/pages/survey3-cameras) is a mini-multispectral that won't give the greatest results, but is small and light enough to be attached to even the DJI Mavic Series drones.  It uses a modified lens on a low-cost camera sensor and requires careful calibration to get usable results.  

## Software for Drones

There are several types of software that may be required for different types of drones and use cases. Here are a few examples:

**Flight planning and control software** This type of software is typically used to plan and control drone flights, it allows you to set waypoints, plan routes, and monitor the drone's flight status in real-time. Some examples include DJI GO, DJI Ground Station Pro, and Pix4Dcapture.

**Photogrammetry Software** - This type of software is used to process the images captured by the drone and create maps, 3D models, and point clouds. Examples include Agisoft Metashape, DroneDeploy, and WebODM.

**Ground control systems** - Ground control systems, such as GNSS Base Stations are typically used for survey-grade drones, as it helps to improve the accuracy of the images captured by the drone, as well as process and analyze the data. 

**Geospatial Analysis Software** - Once you have processed data from a drone, the next step is to analyze the data, commonly in within geographic information system (GIS) software.  GIS software can be used for a variety of analyses such as 3D modeling, change detection, image analysis and surface analysis.


### Photogrammetry Software

The choice between DroneDeploy, Agisoft Metashape, and Pix4D will depend on your specific needs and goals.

**DroneDeploy** is a cloud-based software that is easy to use and well-suited for creating detailed 2D and 3D maps and models of large areas, such as construction sites, mines, and farmland. It also includes features such as automatic flight planning and easy sharing of maps and models.

**Agisoft Metashape** is a photogrammetry software that is used for creating detailed 3D models, orthomosaics, and point clouds from drone-captured images. It is more advanced than DroneDeploy and it is intended for professional users such as surveyors, engineers, and architects. It offers more control over the processing and it can handle larger datasets and more complex projects.

**Pix4D**  offers a complete solution for processing drone data and creating maps, 3D models, and point clouds. It can be used for a wide range of applications such as surveying, agriculture, and construction. Pix4D is known for its high accuracy, advanced features, and the ability to handle large datasets.

If you are a professional user that needs high accuracy and advanced features and have experience with photogrammetry software, Agisoft Metashape or Pix4D might be the best choice. If you are a beginner, or you have a specific use case such as creating maps for agriculture or construction, DroneDeploy might be the best choice for you.

**WebODM** is an open-source software for processing drone-captured images and creating 2D and 3D maps, models and point clouds. It is built on top of the OpenDroneMap (ODM) library and provides a web interface for running ODM on a remote server. However, it is not as advanced as the other commercial softwares.



## Essential Supplemental Drone Equipment

As you build out your drone program, don't forget that you'll need more than just your drone.  Here is a list of our most useful supplemental drone equipment

**Sunshade** - A protective sunshade for your tablet or phone screen while flying a drone is a must-have.  Not only will this help you see your screen better in bright sunlight, it will also significantly reduce the risk of your tablet or phone overheating on those hot summer days.

**MicroSD cards** - Pick up the right microSD card for your drone.  High speed writing is key to ensuring you're getting all of your data.  At a minimum pick up an SD card with a V30 rating or above ([SanDisk Extreme 128GB U3/V30](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B07FCMKK5X?th=1)). V60 or above is prefered for 4K60fps ([Lexar 256 GB V60](https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Professional-Adapter-Class10/dp/B09FJHMLC6/)).

**SD card holder** - At some point, you'll have an abundance of unlabeled microSD cards.  Keep yourself organized with this handy [microSD card holder](https://www.amazon.com/Holder-Storage-Organizer-Lightweight-Portable/dp/B07T6SWXK5/).  Small form factor and a spot to label each card will help keep you organized in the field. 

**Windmeter** - A handheld windmeter is another must-have when operating in the country.  We recommend a full weather meter such as the [Kestrel 2500 Weather Meter](https://kestrelmeters.com/collections/all-kestrel-meters/products/kestrel-2500-weather-meter) - this will provide wind, temperature and barometric pressure measurements.  Remember that most drones use a barometric pressure sensor to help with altitude measurements - by keeping track of the outside barometric pressure, you can determine whether your altitude measurement has drifted up or down during your flight.

**Wristband Playbook** - Pre-flight checklists are an important part of drone safety, but they don't have to be an easily lost sheet of paper on a clip board.  For regular operations or all-day affairs, we recommend using a [wristband playbook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DJJW8QW) instead.  Place your checklist inside of the playbook and never lose it or forget it again.

**Whistle** - At some point you're going to need to communicate across the field. And when time is of the essence, there's no time to fumble with a radio.  A whistle is a great tool to have in the field. Any whistle will do, but we like these Whistles for Life Tri-Power Safety Whistle - [Purchase from Amazon ($10)](https://www.amazon.com/Whistles-Life-Tri-Power-Whistle-Snorkelers/dp/B004RRZIUO/) or bulk-purchase from [WhistlesforLife.com](https://whistlesforlife.com/)
