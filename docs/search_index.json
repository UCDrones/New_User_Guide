This page will be a work in progress and new resources will be added periodically. Feel free to reach out to us at UASSafety@ucmerced.edu if you have any questions or would like to see additional resources added. 1.1 UC Drone Policy There is a University of California Drone Policy that governs the use of drones owned by the University of California, the use of drones at any University property, or the use of drones for any University purpose (including teaching, outreach and research). More information about the UC UAS Policy can be found in the UC UAS Policy Guidance Document located at http://UCDrones.github.io/Policy_Guidance/ 1.1.1 Policy Requirements The Policy establishes that anyone who seeks to operate a UAS under the jurisdiction of the policy must: Comply with any applicable regulation, including but not limited to any applicable FAA regulation. Have prior approval from the Campus Drone Person or the Systemwide Designated Authority. Operate in a manner that ensures public safety, right to privacy, civil rights and civil liberties. Maintain sufficient liability insurance coverage. The UC Center of Excellence on UAS Safety is here to help you comply with the policy. Below are links to several quick guides to help walk you through. 1.2 Complying with Regulations Register your Drone with the FAA Do I need a License?

["ch-register.html", "Chapter 2 Register your Drone 2.1 Create an account at DroneZone 2.2 Drone Registration 2.3 Registration Certificate 2.4 Marking the Drone", " Chapter 2 Register your Drone This page is for the registration of your drone with the Federal Aviation Administration. For information on how to register your drone with the UC system, see Chapter. All drones that weigh more than 0.55 lbs (250 grams) must be registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to it’s legal owner. Any drone purchased through the University of California for university business, including teaching and research, is owned by the Regents of the University of California. You can register the drone through the FAA Drone Zone (https://faadronezone.faa.gov). Registration costs only $5 per aircraft and only takes a couple of minutes. 2.1 Create an account at DroneZone Head to the FAA DroneZone (https://faadronezone.faa.gov) and select “I fly under Part 107 or as a Public Aircraft” 2.1 Figure 2.1: FAA DroneZone Unfortunately, the FAA’s drone registration website does not allow you to register drones for multiple groups or organizations. If you’re registering a drone on behalf of the University of California, you should use your UC email address as your account log in, and use a personal email address account for any personally-owned drones. When you enter your Part 107 Account information, enter Regents of the University of California as your Part 107 Account Name to correctly register the drone to the UC system. 2.2 Drone Registration Once you have an account, on the dashboard will be an option to ‘Manage sUAS Inventory.’ On that page, you’ll be able to ‘Add UAS’ (in the upper right corner). This will bring up a dialog box (Figure 2.2) for you to enter your information. Enter all the relevant information. Figure 2.2: Add new UAS Dialog Box Once completed, ‘Your Shopping Cart’ will now show this drone’s information and a new buttom for ‘Checkout’ will appear. Click the button and the system will guide you through paying for the registration fee. 2.3 Registration Certificate Upon completion of paying for registration, the DroneZone will send you two emails, one with a receipt of payment and the other is a pdf copy of your UAS registration certificate (Figure 2.3). Keep a copy of this registration certificate available at all times while you operate. This can be done by either printing it out and placing it with your drone, or keeping a digital copy on your phone. Figure 2.3: Example UAS Registration Certificate 2.4 Marking the Drone Your drone’s registration number is the 10 digit alphanumeric code that starts with FA. You must mark this on your drone on an external location, where it can be plainly visible. We recommend either using a permanent oil-based fine tip paint marker (Figure 2.4) or creating a label that can be strongly affixed to the drone. We’ve found that regular sharpies or markers are rubbed off too easily to be effective. Figure 2.4: Oil-Based Paint Markers If you’ll be working with a fleet of aircraft, it may also be useful to mark the ‘nickname’ of the drone as well. "],
["ch-license.html", "Chapter 3 Do I need an FAA License? 3.1 When are you Exempt from a drone license 3.2 What is the difference? 3.3 Simple Flowchart 3.4 Other Situations 3.5 Frequently Asked Questions", " Chapter 3 Do I need an FAA License? When operating a drone within the US, there are two different options for regulations: Part 107 Small UAS regulations or the Exception for Limited Recreational Use. By default, UAS operations fall under Part 107 Small UAS regulations, unless you can meet the requirements for the exception for Recreational Use. Part 107 requires that all pilots have a Remote Pilot Certificate with an sUAS rating, more commonly known as a ‘Drone License,’ whereas Recreational Use does not require a Drone License. Many researchers opt to get a Drone License for their research needs, but a Drone License does cost $150 and will take some time to study and prepare for. With the updates introduced in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254), there are more exceptions available in which you may not need to obtain the license. This page is for the Federal Aviation Administration licensing requirements for UAS use. UC Policy will still require a flight request and post flight reporting, regardless of FAA licensing requirements. More information on the UC policy can be found in Chapter . 3.1 When are you Exempt from a drone license For the purposes of drone regulations, the following activities are considered ‘recreational’ for Institutes of Higher Education Instruction of students Academic or research related uses of unmanned aircraft systems that have been approved by the institution Activities undertaken by the institution as part of research projects Other academic activities approved by the institution 3.2 What is the difference? Under Part 107 Drone License required Any purpose ‘Fly only when it is safe’ May request special permissions Above FAA Facility Map altitudes Over People, BVLOS, More than 1 drone at a time Under Recreational Exception No license required Recreation or Approved Academic Activities ‘Fly only in safe locations’ No allowances for advanced operations 3.3 Simple Flowchart Below is a ‘simple’ flowchart that covers most of the typical UAS activity and whether or not you might need an FAA Drone License. 3.4 Other Situations There are other conditions that may require a closer evaluation, including whether you’re a US citizen or if you plan on flying internationally. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to UASsafety@ucmerced.edu for a consultation. Other scenarios that may require a closer look Performing a demonstration Not a US citizen Flying above 400 ft AGL Flying in fog or with limited visibility Flying at night Flying internationally 3.5 Frequently Asked Questions When doing an academic activity, which set of regulations is better? There are advantages and disadvantages to both scenarios. In many cases, the new ‘Recreational Operations’ may be the fastest path forward for simple, rural flight operations. At the current time, academic UAS activities that plan on flying in certain controlled airspace areas, over occupied structures, within 25 ft of another person, or outside of a reasonably controlled flying site, should proceed with 14 CFR 107 regulations. What does it mean to get approval from the FAA to operate within controlled airspace? The FAA is mandating that all controlled airspace access requests for recreational operations be routed through the Low Altitude Authorization Notification Capability system (LAANC) and not by calling the local airport tower. The LAANC system can provide instantaneous authorization via a 3rd party application such as Airmap, KittyHawk, or UASideKick for flight requests below a certain altitude depending on your location. I am planning to fly over a research site that is access controlled and the airspace is uncontrolled, do I need a Drone License? Typically not. This common scenario will typically meet the necessary site requirements for Recreational Operations. I am planning to fly along the beach to monitor coastal erosion, do I need a Drone License? Unless the beach is to be closed to the public, this scenario will likely require a Drone License. I am planning on flying in the campus quad to test a flight controller, do I need a Drone License? If the airspace is uncontrolled (Class G), and the area within the campus quad is sufficiently cleared and closed to non-participants, then you do not need a Drone License. If you want to fly at UCI, UCSB or UCLA, then you will need to obtain an Airspce Authorization via LAANC. I do not have a Drone License, can I do a coursework assignment on the use of drones in building inspections? You may be able to do some flying without a drone license, however, you will not be allowed to fly over a building and must stay at least 25 ft from all non-participants, which may limit your ability to conduct effective analysis. I am a graduate student Teaching Asssistant and I would like to teach my students how to fly a drone? Do I need a license? Do the students need a license? If the site is sufficiently cleared and closed to non-participants, than everyone may have a chance to learn how to fly a drone without a drone license. However, additional safety precautions may be necessary. "],
["ch-get-license.html", "Chapter 4 How to get a License 4.1 Drone License Exam 4.2 Drone License Eligibility", " Chapter 4 How to get a License Obtaining a Remote Pilot Certificate, or more commmonly known as a drone license, is relatively straight-forward 4.1 Drone License Exam 4.2 Drone License Eligibility In order to be eligible to obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate, you must meet the following requirements: Be at least 16 years of age Be able to read, speak and understand the English language. If the applicant is unable to meet one of these requirements due to medical reasons, the FAA may place such operation limitations on that applicant’s certificate as are necessary for the safe operation of the small unmanned aircraft. Not know or have reason to know that he or she has a physical or mental condition that would interfere with the safe operation of a small unmanned aircraft system. However, to take the FAA Airman Knowledge Exam, the proponent must prove their identity with a valid photo ID that includes their date of birth, signature and physical, residential address. For U.S. Citizens and U.S. Resident Aliens, this may be accomplished with one of the following: Driver Permit or License issued by a U.S. state or territory U.S. Government Identification Card U.S. Military Identification Card Passport Alien Residency Card For Non-U.S. Citizens, this may be accomplished with one of the following: Passport and a Driver permit or license issued by a U.S. state or territory. Passport and an Identification card issued by any governmental entity. "],
["ch-common-UAS-violations.html", "Chapter 5 Common UAS Regulation Violations 5.1 Visual Line of Sight 5.2 Operations over Human Beings", " Chapter 5 Common UAS Regulation Violations Unless given special permission by the FAA under Part 107 regulations, you are only allowed to operate Within Visual Line of Sight Not Over People Unfortunately, these are two of the most common UAS violations that we see, especially with videos on the internet. Within the UC system, we are obligated to follow all applicable regulations. So even if you see someone else fly in violation of the laws, it’s not ok for you to replicate it. 5.1 Visual Line of Sight Visual line of sight means that the pilot of the drone must be able to see the drone throughout the entire flight in order to know the drone’s location determine the drone’s attitude (orientation), altitude, and direction of flight observe the airspace for other air traffic or hazards determine that the drone does not endanger the life or property of another The pilot must be able to do the above at all times, but doesn’t have to be at all times - meaning he or she may glance at other objects, as long as the drone never leaves the pilot’s ability to resume looking at the drone at any time. At any given time, at least the pilot or any visual observers must maintain visual line of sight - meaning while the pilot is looking away, there must be a visual observer to watch the drone during that time. 5.1.1 A Speck in the Sky is not Sufficient At all times, your drone must be close enough that you can tell which direction the drone is facing, how high it is and whether there are any hazards. If all you can see of your drone is a small dot, it means you’ve gone too far. In practice, your visual distance may be significantly impaired by trees or buildings in the horizon that may make it difficult to see the drone. Common Drones and recommended max visual distance (on a clear day in a rural location) DJI Mavic Series 900 ft horizontal distance DJI Phantom Series 1200 ft horizontal distance DJI Matrice 600 Pro 3000 ft horizontal distance Fixed-wing (10ft wingspan) 5000 ft horizontal distance 5.1.2 You must be able to assess risk If you can’t see the sky around the drone or the ground below the drone as in Figure 5.1, you’re not within visual line of sight. Figure 5.1: Visual Line of Sight If this is a scenario that you’re looking to do, you may be able to deploy a helper to assist to maintaining a clear flight operational area. However, at no point is the drone allowed to be not viewable by the pilot. 5.2 Operations over Human Beings Your drone is not allowed to be flown directly over people (107.39), or in a manner that poses a hazard to other people in the event of a loss of control of the drone for any reason (107.19(c)). The combination of the two regulations form the majority of the restrictions around people. You may only fly above people who are part of the immediate flight crew and whose tasks include ensuring flight safety. It is not sufficient to provide spectators with personal protective equipment (PPE), or ask spectators to sign waivers. For more information about establishing effective safety buffers, see . "],
["ch-local-UAS-regulations.html", "Chapter 6 Local UAS Regulations 6.1 Searching for Local UAS Regulations 6.2 No Drone Zones", " Chapter 6 Local UAS Regulations Any regulatory agency or private property owner can make rules and regulations within their jurisdiction (within reason). The FAA’s jurisdiction is the sky and aviation support (licensing, registration, infrastructure). However, there are other aspects of UAS activity that may be subject to local rules and regulations. State and local powers include Land Use Trespass Privacy Noise ordinances Wildlife conservation Insurance It is allowed for a State, county or city to place restrictions on where and when drones may take off and land (land use jurisdiction), to define what constitutes invasion of privacy, or to require insurance to operate for or within a jurisdiction. It is your responsibility to The UC Center of Excellence will help assist you in identifying applicable local regulations, however you are responsible for ensuring your regulatory compliance with all local regulations. 6.1 Searching for Local UAS Regulations There is no easy database for applicable UAS regulations - you will likely have to search multiple locations. Most county and state owned land that is set aside for conservation often have established processes for research permits that are good starting points for UAS use. Some good resources: State level regulations are typically associated with state managed lands, wildlife conservation, privacy and insurance. County and Municipal Codes often include regulations for city/county parks and open spaces, typically on land use, trespass and privacy. Directors or on-site managers are often good people to ask for permit processes and costs 6.2 No Drone Zones Please respect local ordinances, even if you do not agree with them. Do not look for ways to circumvent or utilize a loophole if it is counter to the local communities desires. If you are operating for research or education, you are acting as a representative of the University of California, and we strive to be good neighbors and collaborative with all communities. Figure 6.1: No Drone Zone Sign If you feel strongly, engage the local community in outreach and discussion and work to change their views. But recognize that what you want may not ever be what they want, and you may not be able to change their minds. If you are struggling to get access to your desired site, feel free to reach out to us and we’ll see if we can find an alternative location. "]
