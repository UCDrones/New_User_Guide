UC Drone Policy There is a University of California Drone Policy that governs the use of drones owned by the University of California, the use of drones at any University property, or the use of drones for any University purpose (including teaching, outreach and research). More information about the UC UAS Policy can be found in the UC UAS Policy Guidance Document located at http://UCDrones.github.io/Policy_Guidance/ Policy Requirements The Policy establishes that anyone who seeks to operate a UAS under the jurisdiction of the policy must: Comply with any applicable regulation, including but not limited to any applicable FAA regulation. Have prior approval from the Campus Drone Person or the Systemwide Designated Authority. Operate in a manner that ensures public safety, right to privacy, civil rights and civil liberties. Maintain sufficient liability insurance coverage. The UC Center of Excellence on UAS Safety is here to help you guide you through the process.

Were always happy to see new drone pilots and new drone projects. But first, we have to introduce you to the ever-changing drone regulations. Dont forget that following the DRONE regulations are only one part of the UC Drone Policy. Local rules, environmental regulations, export control, and even insurance requirements may require additional steps or have additional restrictions. Helping you navigate through all of this is part of the UC Drone Flight Request process. The Main 7 Rules Dont do anything unsafe All drones must be registered All pilots must have either a Drone License or a TRUST certificate No flying farther than you can see No flying over people No flying above 400 ft Stay away from other aircraft Theres a lot of details behind the above rules, including several exceptions. So lets dive into them in more detail. "],["basic-drone-rules.html", "1.1 Basic Drone Rules", " 1.1 Basic Drone Rules In this page, well introduce some of the basic drone rules. Basically, the rules for operating a drone can be boiled down to Do not do anything unsafe - but sometimes they have to be spelled out. 1.1.1 Drone Operating Rules No flying farther than you can clearly see the drone You must be able to see the drone at all times Figure 1.1: Visual Line of Sight No flying above non-participants or moving cars No flying higher than 400 ft above the ground No reckless or careless flying that endangers the life or property of another No flying when the horizon visibility drops below 3 miles This includes smog, fog, or haze No flying within 2000 ft laterally or 500 ft vertically of any cloud Including fog and low cloud layers on overcast days Figure 1.2: Minimum Distances from Clouds, Fog or Haze No flying faster than 100 mph No flying at night No operating a drone from a moving vehicle 1.1.2 Airspace Rules The drone must always get out of the way and always stay well-clear of all manned aviation traffic, including airplanes, helicopters, gliders, paragliders, hot air balloons and parachutes. Even if you were there first Permission is required to fly in any controlled airspace (Class B, C, D, and surface Class E) Controlled airspace is typically found within 5 miles of most airports for commercial travel and large general aviation airports (non-commercial travel) - See Figure 1.3 Figure 1.3: Small UAS Airspace Rules No interfering with aviation traffic patterns at any airport, heliport, or seaplane base Traffic patterns include more than just the immediate take off and landing - it also includes the downwind and base legs (See Figure 1.4) Figure 1.4: Typical Airport Traffic Patterns (FAA Aeronautical Information Manual) 1.1.3 Operator Rules There must always be a Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC) The RPIC is the one in charge of the flight operations and is ultimately responsible for all safety and operations The RPIC doesnt always have to be the one manipulating the flight controls of the drone - it could be the RPIC is letting a student learn to fly under his/her direct supervision. The RPIC may only operate (supervise) one drone at a time The RPIC must have an FAA Drone License (or be exempt*) More Info Here: FAA Drone License The RPIC must be at least 16 years of age, and must be able to speak, write and understand English. No restriction on nationality but a license does require Federal documentation such as a Passport. No one may operate a drone or act as any direct participant in the operation of a drone if he or she knows, or has reason to know, that he or she has a physical or mental condition that would interfere with the safe operation of the drone. No one may operate a drone or act as any direct participant in the operation of a drone under the influence of alcohol or any drug that may inhibit decision making Figure 1.5: No drugs, alcohol or altered mind-states allowed during flight operations 1.1.4 Drone Rules All drones that weigh more than 0.55 lbs (250 grams) must be registered with the FAA Only use the FAA DroneZone website for registration (More Info here: Register your Drone) Figure 1.6: FAA DroneZone Drones must weigh less than 55 lbs Drones that weigh more than 55 lbs require rare special FAA authorization Drones may not drop or release hazardous material Drones that drop biological or chemical agents for Agriculture require additional Federal and State authorizations While not illegal, please do not drop glitter or confetti from a drone Any payload that is attached to the drone must be securely attached and may not adversely affect the controllability of the drone Weapons are not allowed to be attached or used on drones Tethered drones are not exempt from drone regulations The topic of drone regulations can be very nuanced and complex. Weve shortened it to the basics in this section, but there may be scenarios or situations that may be exempt or have additional restrictions. Always feel free to reach out to us at UASsafety@ucmerced.edu for a one-on-one consultation. "],["registration.html", "1.2 Drone Registration", " 1.2 Drone Registration This page is for the registration of your drone with the Federal Aviation Administration. For information on how to register your drone with the UC system, see Chapter 4.6. 1.2.1 Drone Registration Requirements All drones that weigh more than 0.55 lbs (250 grams) must be registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to its legal owner. Any drone purchased through the University of California for university business, including teaching and research, is owned by the Regents of the University of California. 1.2.2 How to Register You can register the drone through the FAA Drone Zone (https://faadronezone.faa.gov). Registration costs only $5 per aircraft and only takes a couple of minutes. 1.2.3 Create an account at DroneZone Head to the FAA DroneZone (https://faadronezone.faa.gov) and select I fly under Part 107 or as a Public Aircraft 1.7 Figure 1.7: FAA DroneZone Important Note Unfortunately, the FAAs drone registration website does not allow you to register drones for multiple groups or organizations. If youre registering a drone on behalf of the University of California, you should use your UC email address as your account log in, and use a personal email address account for any personally-owned drones. When you enter your Part 107 Account information, enter Regents of the University of California as your Part 107 Account Name to correctly register the drone to the UC system. If you already have an account, go into your profile settings, and you can modify the Part 107 Account Name on the popup. 1.2.4 Drone Registration Once you have an account, on the dashboard will be an option to Manage sUAS Inventory. On that page, youll be able to Add UAS (in the upper right corner). This will bring up a dialog box (Figure 1.8) for you to enter your information. Enter all the relevant information. Figure 1.8: Add new UAS Dialog Box Once completed, Your Shopping Cart will now show this drones information and a new buttom for Checkout will appear. Click the button and the system will guide you through paying for the registration fee. 1.2.5 Registration Certificate Upon completion of paying for registration, the DroneZone will send you two emails, one with a receipt of payment and the other is a pdf copy of your UAS registration certificate (Figure 1.9). Keep a copy of this registration certificate available at all times while you operate. This can be done by either printing it out and placing it with your drone, or keeping a digital copy on your phone. Figure 1.9: Example UAS Registration Certificate 1.2.6 Marking the Drone Your drones registration number is the 10 digit alphanumeric code that starts with FA. You must mark this on your drone on an external location, where it can be plainly visible. We recommend either using a permanent oil-based fine tip paint marker (Figure 1.10) or creating a label that can be strongly affixed to the drone. Weve found that regular sharpies or markers are rubbed off too easily to be effective. Figure 1.10: Oil-Based Paint Markers If youll be working with a fleet of aircraft, it may also be useful to mark the nickname of the drone as well. "],["license.html", "Chapter 2 FAA License Information", " Chapter 2 FAA License Information When operating a drone within the US, there are two different options for regulations: Part 107 Small UAS regulations or the Exception for Limited Recreational Use. By default, UAS operations fall under Part 107 Small UAS regulations, unless you can meet the requirements for the exception for Recreational Use. Part 107 requires that all pilots have a Remote Pilot Certificate with an sUAS rating, more commonly known as a Drone License, whereas Recreational Use requires a TRUST certificate. As of June 2021, all drone pilots must have either: Remote Pilot Certificate (Drone License) TRUST Certificate Many researchers opt to get a Drone License for their research needs, but a Drone License does cost $150 and will take some time to study and prepare for. With the updates introduced in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254), there are more exceptions available in which you may not need to obtain the license. The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST) certificate is a new requirement for all drone pilots without a Drone License. The TRUST certificate is free for everyone, can be done online and takes 20-30 minutes to complete the training. You can obtain your TRUST certificate by completing the drone training at any of websites listed on the FAAs website here: https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/knowledge_test_updates/ This page is for the Federal Aviation Administration licensing requirements for UAS use. UC Policy will still require a flight request and post flight reporting, regardless of FAA licensing requirements. More information on submitting flight requests can be found in Chapter 4. "],["difference.html", "2.1 Which should I Get?", " 2.1 Which should I Get? The Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate, or Drone License, provides for the widest range of permissions and allowances. But there are many cases where a researcher may be satisfied with operating only under the Recreational Exception. But lets explain the difference between the two. Under Part 107 Drone License required May fly for any purpose Fly only when it is safe The pilot is responsible for determining whether the environment and all conditions are safe for a drone flight. The pilot must their best judgment to assess whether the proposed flight operation will put anyone at risk. May request special permissions Above FAA Facility Map altitudes Over People, BVLOS, More than 1 drone at a time Under Recreational Exception TRUST certificate required May fly only for Recreation or Approved Academic Activities Fly only in safe locations The site has been designated by an organization, or is sufficiently clear and controlled, that this environment and location poses the least amount of risk to all participants. The pilot is still responsible for ensuring the safety of the flight, but the location is generally expected to be completely safe. No allowances for advanced operations Must stick to the basic rules for flight operations Flight operations in access controlled locations, such as UC Reserves or agricultural field stations, are generally acceptable for the Recreational Exception. The use of a reserved campus field, such as an Intramural Athletic Field or a Campus quad, may also be acceptable for the Recreational Exception as well. 2.1.1 Approved Academic Activities You may not need a drone license if your flight operations can fit under the stipulations listed for recreational activities and your flight operations are related to Coursework Instruction of students Academic or research related uses of unmanned aircraft systems that have been approved by the institution Activities undertaken by the institution as part of research projects Other academic activities approved by the institution Note that there is no restriction on who the approved academic activities can apply to. Any person associated with the University undertaking the above academic activities are eligible, this includes academic staff or academic support staff. For example, a staff member at a UC Reserve may operate under the academic exception when conducting research activities. However, not all UC activity is academic, even if it is for an academic group. For example, a student flying a drone to take pictures of the Engineering Hall for the Engineering Department is not considered academic. 2.1.2 Simple Drone Regulations Recreational flight operations, despite what you see on YouTube, have strict requirements: Only fly below 400 ft Must stay within Visual Line of Sight Must fly only in safe areas and no closer than 25 ft to any individuals Must use an established safety line to separate all operations from spectators and bystanders Must get FAA authorization to fly in Controlled Airspace (Class B, Class C, Class D and surface Class E) Never fly over any person or moving vehicle Never interfere with any manned aircraft or emergency response activity Never fly under the influence of drugs or alcohol Never operate in a careless or reckless manner In many cases, these regulations are not that restrictive. For research activities in a controlled location, such as an agricultural field station or a natural reserve, it is often easy to abide by these regulations. Commonly the restriction that moves an activity into requiring a Drone license is the proximity to people and buildings, or the activity does not meet the definition of an academic activity. Some example scenarios are discussed in the Frequently Asked Question section in Chapter 2.4. 2.1.3 Other Situations There are other conditions that may require a closer evaluation, including whether youre a US citizen or if you plan on flying internationally. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to UASsafety@ucmerced.edu for a consultation. Other scenarios that may require a closer look Performing a demonstration Not a US citizen Flying above 400 ft AGL Flying in fog or with limited visibility Flying at night Flying internationally Once you know which authorization you need, continue on to read more about how to get it. Remote Pilot Certificate (Drone License) TRUST Certificate "],["get-license.html", "2.2 Drone License", " 2.2 Drone License Obtaining a Remote Pilot Certificate, or more commmonly known as a drone license, is relatively straight-forward. The process is similar to obtaining a drivers license, but with one key exception: there is no driving test component. To get a drone license, you must study for and pass a drone license exam that tests only on your knowledge of aviation rules and safety. The FAA has found that on average, most people study for the exam for about 20 hours and that 90% of test takers pass on the first try. The exam is not particularly challenging, but it requires a lot of memorization. 2.2.1 Drone License Exam The drone license exam (airman knowledge test) is a 120 minute, 60 question exam that goes over a wide range of topics. The topics covered on the exam can be broken down into 12 sections as follows: General UAS regulations Airspace classifications Aviation weather sources Loading and Performance Emergency procedures Crew resource management Radio communication procedures Determining UAS performance Physiological effects of drugs and alcohol Aeronautical decision-making and judgment Airport operations and Maintenance and pre-flight inspection procedures. A more in depth look at these topics can be found on the FAAs website here: (https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/remote_pilot_study_guide.pdf) The most important and most difficult part of the exam is learning how to read and understand the Airspace Maps. Airspace maps pack a lot of information in a small space, so they often look very overwhelming and complex. For more information on how read Airspace Maps, check our tutorial here: Reading an Airspace Map. 2.2.2 Free study resources Here are a few free study resources to aid in studying for the exam: (https://jrupprechtlaw.com/part-107-test-study-guide) (https://northrup.photo/free-faa-part-107-suas-drone-certification-study-guide/) (https://www.3dr.com/docs/faa-part-107-study-guide/part-107-certification-official-study-resources/) Although there are third party Ground school courses offered for a fee, we have found freely available resources to be just as effective. 2.2.3 Drone License Eligibility In order to be eligible to obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate, you must meet the following requirements: Be at least 16 years of age Be able to read, speak and understand the English language. If the applicant is unable to meet one of these requirements due to medical reasons, the FAA may place such operation limitations on that applicants certificate as are necessary for the safe operation of the small unmanned aircraft. Not know or have reason to know that he or she has a physical or mental condition that would interfere with the safe operation of a small unmanned aircraft system. However, to take the FAA Airman Knowledge Exam, the proponent must prove their identity with a valid photo ID that includes their date of birth, signature and physical, residential address. For U.S. Citizens and U.S. Resident Aliens, this may be accomplished with one of the following: Driver Permit or License issued by a U.S. state or territory U.S. Government Identification Card U.S. Military Identification Card Passport Alien Residency Card For Non-U.S. Citizens, this may be accomplished with one of the following: Passport and a Driver permit or license issued by a U.S. state or territory. Passport and an Identification card issued by any governmental entity. 2.2.4 Taking the Drone Exam The process to take the drone exam is a bit more complicated than just signing up for it. This is a short overview of the process - for more details, you can visit the FAAs website here: Becoming a Drone Pilot Obtain an FAA Tracking Number (FTN) by creating an Integrated Airman Certification and Rating Application (IACRA) profile prior to registering for a knowledge test. Go to https://iacra.faa.gov/IACRA/Default.aspx to create your profile. Make sure you write down your FTN because youll need it to register for the drone test in the next step. Schedule an appointment with a FAA-approved Knowledge Testing Center. We recommend using the PSI Exams website to search for a nearby FAA testing facility and registering for the exam. The test you are looking for is Unmanned Aircraft General  Small (UAG). Study and do a good job on the test. Be sure to bring a government-issued photo ID to your test. After you complete the test, youll need to go back to the IACRA system to register your score. Dont worry, your testing center will provide you with the instructions on how to do this. Once you register your score with the FAA, they will send you your permanent remote pilot certificate via mail. This might take 4-6 weeks to process, but in the interim, you can download a temporary permit from the IACRA website. 2.2.5 License Renewal In order to maintain your authorization to fly a drone using your Remote Pilot Certificate, you need to renew it every two years. Starting in April 2021, the recurrent knowledge training is now available for free and online. Part 107 Small UAS Recurrent Non-Part 61 Pilots (ALC-677) Available at: https://www.faasafety.gov/gslac/ALC/course_content.aspx?cID=677. 2.2.5.1 Training Information The training consists of 3 modules - Introduction, Aircraft and RPIC Requirements, and Safe Operation of sUAS. Each module will have some knowledge tests inside, and after completion of all three modules, there is the required online end-of-training knowledge check. And it has the new information about remote ID, flying over people and flying at night operations. The end-of-training knowledge check is a 45 question test  youll have 90 minutes to complete it, and while you cant leave the page, youre welcome to open up another browser and review the information while youre taking the test. Once you complete the test, make sure you get a copy of your training completion certificate. Dont forget that you can upload it to your pilot profile in UC Drones. This way, youll always know of a location where it is kept. You are also able to email it directly to us at UASsafety@ucmerced.edu and we can attach it to your profile. 2.2.5.2 Notes Make sure you sign in and enroll in the course before starting.

The test is free for everyone and takes 20-30 minutes to complete. The FAA provides education and testing content to FAA Approved Test Administrators of TRUST, who in turn provide the content to recreational flyers for free. You may take The Recreational UAS Safety Test at any of the administrators found on the FAAs website: https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/knowledge_test_updates/ The TRUST is divided into two sections: The first section provides you with the information needed to pass the test. The second section is a series of multiple choice questions. You cannot fail the test. If you answer a question incorrectly you will be provided with information on why the answer you chose was incorrect and will be promoted to try again. Upon completion of the TRUST you will receive a completion certificate. The certificate never expires however if you lose your certificate you will need to re-take the test and obtain a new certificate. Neither the test administrator, nor the FAA, will maintain personally identifiable information about the recreational flyer so it is not possible to re-print or re-issue your original certificate. We recommend uploading your certificate to UC Drones so that you have a backup copy available. 2.3.1 What is TRUST? TRUST is The Recreational UAS Safety Test. It provides education and testing for recreational flyers on important safety and regulatory information. If you fly your drone recreationally under the Exception for Recreational Flyers you must pass the test before you fly - this includes both recreational use and certain academic use-cases. 2.3.2 Taking the TRUST You may take the free online test through any of the approved test administrators listed on the FAAs website here: https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/knowledge_test_updates/. After you complete the TRUST, you will be given the option to download your TRUST certificate and write down your Authentication Token. We recommend uploading your TRUST certificate and entering your Authentication Token into your pilot profile within UC Drones. "],["license-FAQ.html", "2.4 Frequently Asked Questions", " 2.4 Frequently Asked Questions When doing an academic activity, which set of regulations is better? There are advantages and disadvantages to both scenarios. In many cases, the new Recreational Operations may be the fastest path forward for simple, rural flight operations. At the current time, academic UAS activities that plan on flying in certain controlled airspace areas, over occupied structures, within 25 ft of another person, or outside of a reasonably controlled flying site, should proceed with 14 CFR 107 regulations. What does it mean to get approval from the FAA to operate within controlled airspace? The FAA is mandating that all controlled airspace access requests for recreational operations be routed through the Low Altitude Authorization Notification Capability system (LAANC) and not by calling the local airport tower. The LAANC system can provide instantaneous authorization via a 3rd party application such as Airmap, KittyHawk, or UASideKick for flight requests below a certain altitude depending on your location. I am planning to fly over a research site that is access controlled and the airspace is uncontrolled, do I need a Drone License? Typically not. This common scenario will typically meet the necessary site requirements for Recreational Operations. I am planning to fly along the beach to monitor coastal erosion, do I need a Drone License? Unless the beach is to be closed to the public, this scenario will likely require a Drone License. I am planning on flying in the campus quad to test a flight controller, do I need a Drone License? If the airspace is uncontrolled (Class G), and the area within the campus is sufficiently cleared and closed to non-participants, then you do not need a Drone License and can get the TRUST certificate. However, there are some parts of some of the UC campuses that are in controlled airspace where a Drone License is required. Please check with your Campus Drone Point of Contact for more information. I do not have a Drone License, can I do a coursework assignment on the use of drones in building inspections with a TRUST certificate? You may be able to do some flying with only a TRUST certificate, however, you will not be allowed to fly over a building and must stay at least 25 ft from all non-participants, which may limit your ability to conduct effective analysis. I am a graduate student Teaching Assistant and I would like to teach my students how to fly a drone? Do I need a license? Do the students need a license? If the site is sufficiently cleared and closed to non-participants, than everyone may have a chance to learn how to fly a drone with only a TRUST certificate and any instructor may only have a TRUST certificate. However, additional safety precautions may be necessary and as an instructor, you will be responsible for ensuring the safety of the students and the site. "],["airspace-info.html", "Chapter 3 Airspace information", " Chapter 3 Airspace information When your figuring out where you want to fly, youre typically thinking about your research objectives on the ground. But you must also think about whether or not it will be safe to fly a drone in the airspace at that location. You wont find this information on Google Maps though - you need to check the Airspace Maps or Aviation Charts. Reading an Airspace Map is not like reading Google Maps - youll rarely see roads or buildings marked - instead youll be presented with a whole new set of symbols and strange codes. But theyre all very important to convey a dense set of aviation information. Luckily with drones, you wont have to worry about most of it, but theres still some very important pieces of information you need to know. Theres a lot of rules about flying drones and many of them are related to where and how risky. For more information about Airspace Class and their rules, check out the Regulations and the Reading an Airspace Map pages. "],["what-is-airspace.html", "3.1 What is Airspace?", " 3.1 What is Airspace? The Federal Aviation Administration is in charge of making the rules and regulations for everyone in the United States flying above the ground. While the National Airspace System (NAS) does not have roads or streets like we have on the ground, there are a lot of rules about how to use the airspace correctly for the safety of others1. 3.1.1 Airspace Classes Since aviation works in 3 dimensions, so do the airspace rules. Figure 3.1 gives a side profile of how the airspace is separated into different Classes. Figure 3.1: Small UAS Airspace Rules Class A - Airlines Class A is not shown in Figure 3.1, but exists way up high between 18,000 ft and 60,000 ft above sea level - this is where commercial airliners fly and where our drones should not be. Flying up this high requires special coordination with Air Traffic Control to guide pilots to their destinations. Class B - Big Airports Class B airspace is found around the biggest airports in the country - including LAX and SFO. Every Class B airspace is individually tailored as needed to help guide aircraft around these busy areas. This usually involves 2 or more different sized layers at different altitudes - imagine an aircraft taking off from a runway and staying in Class B airspace until it leaves the busiest areas. Given the amount of air traffic around these airports, no one is allowed to fly in Class B airspace unless Air Traffic Control says its ok. Class C - Common Airports Class C airspace is found around some of the more common regional airports, such as the Sacramento or Fresno airports. Theyre busy areas, but not nearly as busy as the major airports, and so they dont need to control as much of the sky as them. Class D - Dinky Airports Class D airspace is found around small airports that dont have a lot of commercial airline traffic, mostly catering to private aviation use, such as the airports in Stockton or Palm Springs. But as with Class B and C airspace, no one is allowed to fly within Class D airspace without permission. Class E - the Everywhere Airspace Class E airspace is the other airspace that is not part of Class A, B, C, D or G airspace. Fun fact, there are 7 different classifications of Class E airspace. But as a drone pilot, the most important consideration of Class E airspace is when your in the part of Class E airspace at the surface that is designated for an airport. In that case, youll also need to get permission to fly in that airspace. Class G - The Ground Airspace Class G airspace is the airspace at the ground - starting from the ground and going up to either 700 ft or 1200 ft above the ground, depending on location. This is the only airspace that drones are allowed to fly in without getting prior permission. This is true even if youre near an airport. Very small airports, such as those for cropdusters or personal use, do exist in Class G airspace. Though they do not control the airspace near them, you should make sure you stay out of their way. 3.1.2 What do you need to know? Theres a lot of information to unpack when looking into airspace information. As you try to figure out if your location will be safe, youll want to look up: Airspace Class Nearby Airports, including smaller ones and helipads Potential air traffic patterns Special Use Airspace - Military Operating Areas, Controlled Firing Ranges, National Security Areas, and Restricted Areas Flying altitude limits within certain zones or grids Temporary Flight Restrictions or special alerts "],["how-to-get-airspace-information.html", "3.2 How to get Airspace Information", " 3.2 How to get Airspace Information So where can you find this information? We recommend two sources: Airmap (3rd party application and website) Official FAA Sources - VFR Sectional Charts, FAA Facility Maps, TFR/NOTAMs 3.2.1 Airmap The most comprehensive and easy to use Drone airspace map system is Airmap. Just type in your address or find your spot on the map, and see whats around you. Airmap is available as both a webpage (Figure 3.2) and as an app for iOS or Android (Figure 3.3). Once you find your flying spot on the map, you can evaluate many of the airspace issues you need to look for. For example, in Figure 3.2, the selected flying spot is within a grid box within the purple shaded region. The text box to the bottom left gives a brief explanation - the purple shaded region is MERCED CLASS E2 airspace - meaning that the location is located within the vicinity of the Merced Airport. Any drone flying within any purple of blue shaded region will require permission from the FAA. Class E2 is the least riskiest of the airport managed airspace (also known as controlled airspace), but still will have some airspace risk with occasional planes and helicopters flying above. Figure 3.2: Android Airmap Application For requesting permission to fly within a shaded region (controlled airspace), the FAA and the airports have drawn up grids within the shaded regions and labeled each one with a generally safe upper limit for flying. Within the highlighted grid in Figure 3.2, this limit is 200 ft. If you ask the FAA for permission to fly up to 200 ft, you will always be given approval. In general, the farther away you are from the runway, the higher the altitude you will be allowed to fly. But thats not always the case - youll notice, there are a couple of grids that are marked with a 0 - and yes, that means that the generally safe flying altitude is 0 ft. Need to get FAA permission to fly in one of these areas, head over here What if you need to fly higher than the altitude listed? If you have a drone pilot license, you may ask the FAA for permission - but it is not guaranteed to be approved. Obtaining permission for flights above the listed altitude can be tricky, so we recommend reaching out to us at UASsafety@ucmerced.edu and well be happy to walk you through the process. Reach out to us early - the FAA can take 5-10 days to grant approval so you want to start this process early. Airmap also does a good job of depicting other airspace issues, such as Special Use Airspace and National Security Areas - marked in red as in Figure 3.3. Selecting the AIRMAP Recommended Guidelines layer will also show all the helipads and minor airports that are not normally shown on an airspace map. This can be critically important - low flying helicopters and cropdusters that fly out of these unmarked airports are among the most pressing airspace concerns. Make sure you click on the Layers Icon next to the Flight Advisories - this allows you to turn on/off different information. For most operations, we recommend selecting the following sets of information: FAA Part 107 Certified AIRMAP Recommend Guidelines Restricted and Special Use Airspace National Parks Public Use Limits NOAA Regulated Overflight Zones Fish and Wildlife Service Lands Use Limits Wilderness Areas Use Limits Figure 3.3: Android Airmap Application 3.2.2 The importance of up-to-date Airspace Information Having the most up-to-date airspace information on hand can make all the difference between having a safe flight and a risky one. One of the advantages of Airmap is that it will also display a number of Temporary Flight Restrictions and Notices to Airman. Especially in California, there are a number of these that we should always keep an eye on: Disneyland - Due to National Security Risks, the FAA has banned all aircraft from flying under 3000 ft within 3 miles of Disneyland. This essentially also bans all drones in the area as well. Major League Baseball, National Football League and Division 1 College Football Regular and Post-Season Games - Similarly to the Disneyland restriction, the FAA has banned all aircraft from flying under 3000 ft within 3 miles of any these games. The ban starts at 1 hour before the games begin to 1 hour after the game ends. Wildfire and other Natural Disasters - Whenever there is a major catastrophe, keep an eye out for Temporary Flight Restrictions. These will often be very large and prolonged to allow emergency services (firefighting aircraft, medical support, etc) to have priority in these areas. Never fly your drone in a manner that could interfere with emergency services - it is both a Federal offense and a State offense. US President and Vice-President Travel - The President (30 mile) and Vice-President (5 mile) travel with their own FAA flight restriction zones, similarly prohibiting all aircraft from flying under 3000 ft within their zones. As with most drone related rules and regulations, there are nuances and exceptions to TFRs and NOTAMs. If you have a pressing need to operate within a TFR, reach out to us at UASsafety@ucmerced.edu to discuss. 3.2.3 Official FAA Sources Using Airmap is one of the easiest methods for looking up most of the airspace issues. However, its not always the most detailed nor is it the official source of information. The official sources of information is spread across a handful of different sites: Official source of airspace information - FAA Sectional Charts Official source of altitude grid information - UAS Facility Maps Official source of TFR or NOTAMS - FNS NOTAM Search Always check multiple sources - you never know when one source omits an important piece of information. For example, Figure 3.4 is the default view of Orange County of the UAS Facility Maps, but its doesnt depict one very critical flight restriction. 3.2.3.1 FAA Sectional Charts FAA sectional chart Getting information on a specific areas airspace classification has never been easier. The FAA has region specific sectional charts located here. 3.2.4 UAS Facility Maps Figure 3.4: UAS Facility Map UAS Facility Maps show the maximum altitudes around airports where the FAA may authorize drone operations without additional safety analysis. Grids marked in Green are LAANC (Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability) enabled - More on that in LAANC Authorization. 3.2.5 NOTAM or Notice To Airman FAA NOTAM (Notice to Airman) A NOTAM or Notice to Airman, is a notice that pertains to the establishment, change or condition of any facility, service or procedure of a specific location. The information is not known far enough in advance to be publicized by any other means therefore ensuring there are no active NOTAMS in the area you will be flying in is essential to the safety of yourself and others. It is important to keep in mind that NOTAMS can be put up at a moments notice. 3.2.6 Other Sources Two other useful sources of information are Skyvector and the B4UFly App (iOS and Android). 3.2.6.1 SkyVector Figure 3.5: SkyVector - VFR Chart viewer with TFRs SkyVector is a manned aviation tool that allows users to view the FAA Sectional Charts (also known as VFR charts) as well as a wide range of other layers, including TFRs and IFR approaches. While most of the information will be overwhelming for the beginning drone pilot, the basic VFR charts are still a great resource. 3.2.6.2 B4UFly App The B4UFly App has been redesigned by Aloft (formerly kittyhawk.io) and now includes a lot of good information. It also now includes an integration with the Aloft App to review FAA facility maps and file LAANC requests. B4UFly App Figure 3.6: B4UFly 3.2.7 Airspace Regulations On this page, were only looking at how to get the most basic of airspace information. But obviously, theres a deeper level of knowledge to be studied when it comes to airspace regulations. Youll find more information on the UAS Regulations and Learning About Airspace page, but for now, you can take a quick look at Figure 3.7 below. Figure 3.7: Small UAS Airspace Rules "],["LAANC.html", "3.3 LAANC Authorization", " 3.3 LAANC Authorization In order to get FAA authorization to fly in controlled airspace, you typically will need to file a request through a system called LAANC (pronounced lance) If you plan on flying below the Facility Map altitude maximum, authorization will be instantaneous. If you want to request flying above the Facility Map altitude maximum, youll need a Part 107 license and youll need to make a safety case within your request. Flight requests are automatically denied if they have not been resolved 24 hours prior to flight, so we recommend filing a request at least 1 week in advance. 3.3.1 Using AirMap One of our favorite programs to use for simple and free airspac authorizations is AirMap. The process is relatively straightfoward. Create an account, input your pilot and aircraft information, then find a place to fly. Point to a spot on the map, draw a polygon or even just a line to describe your flight area then submit your flight plan. Itll go straight to the FAA, or if manual approval by the tower is necessary, itll go straight to the tower.

In this chapter, well go over a variety of safety tips, including some standard guidance, mission planning guidance and fire safety. Figure 5.1: DroneCamp Training Workshop "],["drone-safety-standards.html", "5.1 Drone Safety Standards", " 5.1 Drone Safety Standards Theres a lot of items to consider when it comes to drone safety. Here, well just give a couple of standard guidance: 5.1.1 Standard Guidance Establish a buffer or safe-zone between the Unmanned Aircraft and any non-participating persons or sensitive locations. A good rule-of-thumb is to maintain a buffer or safe-zone of roughly \\(\\frac{1}{4}^{th}\\) of the flight altitude. Visual Observers and supporting ground crew should be utilized when available. Supporting ground crew should assist in ensuring safety to all non-participating persons. All members of the flight crew should be conspicuous and wear professional, identifying apparel such as university-branded hats, shirts or lanyards with IDs. High visibility reflective vests must be worn when operating near roads or in parking lots. When operating in fenced areas, stay within the fenced areas unless there is sufficient visibility on the other side to ensure safety to non-participants. Never fly in areas where drone activity is prohibited or restricted. Always be a good neighbor and ensure that your drone activity is not disruptive to other authorized activities. Pay attention to sloping terrain and trees. It is too easy to misjudge and autonomously fly into a tree. Figure 5.2: UAS operators with high visiblity vests, UC Merced 5.1.2 Operating on Campus or other busy locations Utilize the UC UAS Mission Planning Template (link) to systematically develop your flight plan Pre-plan each flight in detail when operating in uncontrolled locations in proximity to non-participating person. Use this planning to look for potential safety issues and identify mitigating actions. High visibility vests are recommended when near nonparticipants or in public areas. Dont rely on passive crowd control measures such as Orange cones. Supplement any portable pedestrian control equipment (cones, caution tape, signs) with ground personnel. If spectators are expected, a supporting ground crew member should be tasked with preventing spectators from distracting the RPIC with questions or comments. When operating near roads, a supporting ground crew member should be tasked with being located near the road to monitor traffic, and if necessary, retrieve a fallen Unmanned Aircraft before it becomes a road hazard. Flying above buildings and structures may minimize risk to pedestrians, but contact the facility manager to properly evaluate the potential risks. Some campus buildings are outfitted with research or communication equipment on rooftops. "],["mission.html", "5.2 Planning a Mission", " 5.2 Planning a Mission Plan your flight mission with safety in mind from the get go. Use the Site Analysis process to figure out exactly how to accomplish your mission and determine any other supplies or support you might need. 5.2.1 Site Analysis Process One of the best things you can do when you start planning your mission is to conduct a thorough site analysis process. Do a methodical review of where you want to fly, taking into consideration what you want out of the flight and any hazards that exist. Following your methodical review, you can start planning your flight paths, assess visibility, decided where to put VOs or other helpers, and have ample details for any emergency action plans. 5.2.2 Site Analysis Steps Print out a satellite image of the site Evaluate Data Requirements Identify the region(s) of interest Identify the best visual angles Consider the time of day, shadows and reflective surfaces Estimate the best flight region and flight paths Identify any constraints Mark any airspace issues Airspace Class Airports, Heliports Flight Patterns Mark any vertical structures Changes in elevation Buildings Towers, powerlines Trees Other vertical obstructions Mark any ground obstructions Smaller structures Gates, Fences Hedges, Shrubs Other obstructions that may impede access Identify any other safety or regulatory issue Fire risks Wildlife impacts Physical access to site Identify potential site access points by non-participants Pedestrian walkways Bike paths Building doors/access points Refine flight plan with constraints Select a launch/recovery site that can be reasonably secured Assess whether any vertical structure may impede visual line of sight Assess whether any ground obstruction may limit any emergency recovery operations Consider multiple flights per Mission to achieve mission goals Plan flight crew locations Pilot and VO at Launch/Recovery point Consider if Pilot/VO may require relocation during flight operation Remote VOs and other ground crew support May be tasked to redirect non-participant traffic away from flight zone Iterate as necessary to meet Mission Objectives 5.2.3 Site Analysis Guide 5.2.4 Resources Make regular use of planning tools and resources here: UC Drones Resources.

"],["fire-safety.html", "5.3 Fire Safety", " 5.3 Fire Safety While UAS accidents and incidents involving fire are rare, they are a valid and significant concern. With the majority of UC UAS usage on field sites and other rural locations, the potential for the accidental sparking of fire is a concern. A fire sparked by a UAS can spread quickly (Figure 5.3) and with Californias dry environment, can cause significant damage (Figure 5.4). Everyone who flies a drone within the UC should take the Drone Fire Safety Training Course Figure 5.3: Beginning of a fire from UAS accident at Richmond Field Station, UC Berkeley Figure 5.4: Post fire damage from UAS accident at Richmond Field Station, UC Berkeley 5.3.1 LiPo Battery Guidance The most common cause of drone related fire is from misuse of LiPo batteries. Special care should be taken when charging, discharging or storing LiPo batteries. If the internal polymer cell of a LiPo battery is exposed to air, a violent chemical reaction starts that could explode, but more commonly releases significant amounts of smoke and heat that can ignite other fire fuel sources. A LiPo battery fire is typically caused by a physical puncture to the battery or from misuse, such as overcharging or electrical shorts. Recommended Best Practices Always thoroughly inspect a battery before charging and use. Look for swelling, puffy cells, cracks in plastic, and charred debris along the contacts. Never use a battery that is not in good health. Consider batteries to be replaceable and consumable, rather than a permanent component of the UAS. Never store batteries in a hot car. Dont charge your batteries unless youre going to fly within the next day. After immediate use, place battery out of the sun but do not place within a closed container. Ensure there is sufficient airflow to allow the battery to cool. When done flying for the day, always charge your batteries at least back up to storage level. Do not charge an intelligent flight battery immediately after flight as the temperature may be too high. Wait until it cools down to room temperature before charging again. Store the battery in a dry and cool place, keep out of direct sunlight and away from any liquids Do not store or transport a battery with eyeglasses, watches, metal necklaces or other metal components that may short the battery When in transport, store the batteries in a safe container that will protect it from damage, squeezing, puncturing or falling. 5.3.2 Planning for Fire Mitigation In addition to LiPo battery care, special effort must be taken to consider the fire risks in drone activity. Consult the appropriate department (Fire, Field Safety, EH&amp;S) if there are concerns over fire risk. Minimize the potential for fire by monitoring where the drone will be flying and ensure that if a fire was to occur, the RPIC and any other persons, such as Visual Observers, are prepared to respond appropriately. Guidance for fire safety Everyone should take the drone fire safety training course Avoid flying on high fire risk days, including Red Flag Warning alerts issued by CAL FIRE. Never fly alone in areas of moderate to high fire risk Always bring a fire extinguisher and a shovel/bucket of sand to field sites. During flight operations: Ensure that a crew member has easy access to fire equipment. Ensure that a crew member has easy access to reach any location where the drone may crash. Ensure that a crew member has the ability to report an emergency situation and can adequately provide directions for emergency personnel to reach the site. When flying in high fire risk locations, use high quality, commercially available drones with enclosed electronics. Never fly a damaged or swollen battery. 5.3.3 Drone Fire Safety Bucket Come prepared for a fire by packing this Drone Fire Safety Bucket, designed by Victor Duraj at UC Davis. It is based around a 7-gallon red bucket in order to accommodate a larger extinguisher, to help the bucket physically stand out on a flight site, and to reference it efficiently in an emergency as that red fire bucket. It includes a screw top lid, a fire extinguisher, a fire blanket, a folding camp shovel, a fluorescent orange flag, a first aid kit, a storage clipboard, self-made labels, and a double-sided laminated Contents &amp; Instructions sheet. Figure 5.5: Drone Fire Bucket Contents &amp; Instruction Sheet "],["tips.html", "5.4 Top 10 Safety Tips", " 5.4 Top 10 Safety Tips Good pilots arent born, they are forged with training, practice and experience. When starting on your drone journey, follow these 10 tips for being a safe pilot. Practice - There is no substitute for experience. Gain experience by practicing flying your drone, conducting data collection missions, and flight planning. Get familiar with your equipment and processes. Write Everything Down - Keeping records can help you maintain your equipment, monitor for unsafe practices and keep you on track. Things to track: battery usage, weather conditions, equipment use/damage, software versions. Make Checklists and Use Them - Nothing derails a flight mission like forgetting an item or a step. Make a checklist for planning a mission, make a checklist for packing your equipment, make a checklist for preflight inspections and any other process you may have. Always Keep an Eye on the Weather - Experienced field researchers know that weather reports are only a suggestion. Conditions in the field may change dramatically and can turn a good flying day to a disaster. Bring a friend or two - Between juggling a flight controller, operating a payload, monitoring weather conditions and scanning for intruding air traffic, it can be taxing to try to do it all at an appropriate level. Bring some help to make sure everything goes smoothly. Bring backups or replacement parts - Many operators will bring spare propellers or batteries to their flight missions, but dont forget about other supporting equipment such as cables, landing gear, radios or antennas. Make sure backup parts are on your pre-departure checklist. Choose appropriate flight locations - When you choose a location to fly at, make sure youre aware of all the hazards. Look for indicators of hidden hazards like rolling hills or high tree lines that create turbulence, or low visibility hazards such as power-lines or towers that interfere with radio systems. Be aware that you as the pilot are responsible of ensuring the safety of all persons on the ground, whether you can see them or not. Set boundaries for go/no-go situations and stick to them - Deciding when to fly and when not to fly should not be an ambiguous decision. Dont let external pressures push you to make unsafe decisions. If something isnt right, stop immediately - Nothing fixes itself in the air. If something doesnt sound right on the ground during pre-flight checks, dont fly. If the weather changes to an unsafe condition, land as soon as it is safe. Pause and consider all the risks before you fly - Damage to your aircraft is only one of many aspects to consider. Consider the payload, consider potential damage to others property, consider secondary effects such as causing an auto accident when your aircraft crashes in the middle of a road.

With a 25 minute flight time and a mechanical shutter, its capable of small mapping missions up to 10 acres at a time. Great for small projects and flight training. Unfortunately, this drone is no longer being produced and is getting harder to find. Mavic 2 Pro  They stopped selling this last year with the release of the Mavic 3, but the Mavic 2 Pro is compatible with all major mapping software and has a decent enough camera system to get good results. If you can find one on Amazon or elsewhere, its worth picking up. While it doesnt have a mechanical shutter, its still a great platform for basic mapping projects (RGB only). Mavic 2 Zoom  Similar to the Mavic 2 Pro, but the camera isnt as widely compatible. Itll work with Drone Deploy, but not with Pix4DCapture. Much better as a flight trainer than for completing missions. Mavic Air 2  Nice compact drone for regular flying, but also not as widely available since the release of its successor Mavic Air 2S. Is compatible with Drone Deploy with iOS, but nothing else. Mavic Air 2S  You can still find this one available, but stock is dwindling as DJI prepares for the launch of the Mavic Air 3. DroneDeploy compatibility is in BETA testing - this might be the last entry level DJI drone to be compatible with mapping software such as Drone Deploy. Skydio 2+ - The only non-DJI drone compatible with DroneDeploy. Its smaller than a Mavic, and the camera is not as high quality, but as DJI moves away from compatibility with mapping software, its worth checking out for basic/simple flight missions. Autel Robotics EVO II - Another rare non-DJI drone. Its a worthy Mavic competitor and unlike the DJI drones, has mapping software functionality built-in. A little pricier, but worth exploring. 8.1.2 Drones for Videos Mavic 3 - The DJI Mavic 3 is a great drone. It boasts a 45 minute flight time, a great camera and almost all the features you could want from a drone - except its not compatible with mapping software. If youre just doing cinematography, its a good albeit pricey option at $2k ($2.8k with the extra battery combo pack). Mini 2/3 - The DJI Mini series are great, affordable and high-quality small drones. At only 249g, it packs a lot a capability into a tiny platform. Its great as a flight trainer and good enough for some media use. DJI Avata - This is DJIs first entry into the FPV world, but its not for everyone. Its designed for high-speed acrobatics, so its not a great drone for newcomers as it handles different than other DJI drones. But if youre looking to add some up-close action shots, its a good option. 8.1.3 Drones to Avoid Off-Brand Drones - DJI has the largest marketshare for drones, but its not unwarranted. Any drone you can find on Amazon or at Costco, BestBuy or Target that isnt a DJI, is likely to under-perform. Drone companies to avoid - Holy Stone, DEERC, ORKNELY, etc Tello - The Ryze Tellos have a partnership with DJI, but are not DJI drones and it shows. With poor flight handling and a very limited range, these $100 drones should only be used indoors and only for specific STEM curriculum activities - theyre not useful as a tool or for flight training.

Here is a list of our most useful supplemental drone equipment Sunshade - A protective sunshade for your tablet or phone screen while flying a drone is a must-have. Not only will this help you see your screen better in bright sunlight, it will also significantly reduce the risk of your tablet or phone overheating on those hot summer days. MicroSD cards - Pick up the right microSD card for your drone. High speed writing is key to ensuring youre getting all of your data. At a minimum pick up an SD card with a V30 rating or above (SanDisk Extreme 128GB U3/V30). V60 or above is prefered for 4K60fps (Lexar 256 GB V60). SD card holder - At some point, youll have an abundance of unlabeled microSD cards. Keep yourself organized with this handy microSD card holder. Small form factor and a spot to label each card will help keep you organized in the field. Windmeter - A handheld windmeter is another must-have when operating in the country. We recommend a full weather meter such as the Kestrel 2500 Weather Meter - this will provide wind, temperature and barometric pressure measurements. Remember that most drones use a barometric pressure sensor to help with altitude measurements - by keeping track of the outside barometric pressure, you can determine whether your altitude measurement has drifted up or down during your flight. Wristband Playbook - Pre-flight checklists are an important part of drone safety, but they dont have to be an easily lost sheet of paper on a clip board. For regular operations or all-day affairs, we recommend using a wristband playbook instead. Place your checklist inside of the playbook and never lose it or forget it again. Whistle - At some point youre going to need to communicate across the field. And when time is of the essence, theres no time to fumble with a radio. A whistle is a great tool to have in the field. Any whistle will do, but we like these Whistles for Life Tri-Power Safety Whistle - Purchase from Amazon ($10) or bulk-purchase from WhistlesforLife.com "],["other-information.html", "Chapter 9 Other Information", " Chapter 9 Other Information Do you have other questions?

Within the UC system, we are obligated to follow all applicable regulations. So even if you see someone else fly in violation of the laws, its not ok for you to replicate it. 9.1.1 Visual Line of Sight Visual line of sight means that the pilot of the drone must be able to see the drone throughout the entire flight in order to know the drones location determine the drones attitude (orientation), altitude, and direction of flight observe the airspace for other air traffic or hazards determine that the drone does not endanger the life or property of another The pilot must be able to do the above at all times, but doesnt have to be at all times - meaning he or she may glance at other objects, as long as the drone never leaves the pilots ability to resume looking at the drone at any time. At any given time, at least the pilot or any visual observers must maintain visual line of sight - meaning while the pilot is looking away, there must be a visual observer to watch the drone during that time. 9.1.1.1 A Speck in the Sky is not Sufficient At all times, your drone must be close enough that you can tell which direction the drone is facing, how high it is and whether there are any hazards. If all you can see of your drone is a small dot, it means youve gone too far. In practice, your visual distance may be significantly impaired by trees or buildings in the horizon that may make it difficult to see the drone. Common Drones and recommended max visual distance (on a clear day in a rural location) DJI Mavic Series 900 ft horizontal distance DJI Phantom Series 1200 ft horizontal distance DJI Matrice 600 Pro 3000 ft horizontal distance Fixed-wing (10ft wingspan) 5000 ft horizontal distance 9.1.1.2 You must be able to assess risk If you cant see the sky around the drone or the ground below the drone as in Figure 9.2, youre not within visual line of sight. Figure 9.2: Visual Line of Sight If this is a scenario that youre looking to do, you may be able to deploy a helper to assist to maintaining a clear flight operational area. However, at no point is the drone allowed to be not viewable by the pilot. 9.1.2 Operations over Human Beings Starting April 2021, drones may be issued a special Category certification that allows for operations over people. Table 9.1 contains an overview of the requirements and restrictions for flight operations over people. Category 0, or Unlisted Drones that do not have the Category certification are prohibited from operations over people. In addition to your drone not being allowed to be flown directly over people (107.39), they are prohibited from flying in a manner that poses a hazard to other people in the event of a loss of control of the drone for any reason (107.19(c)). The combination of the two regulations form the majority of the restrictions around people. For drones without the correct Category Certification, you may only fly above people who are part of the immediate flight crew and whose tasks include ensuring flight safety. It is not sufficient to provide spectators with personal protective equipment (PPE), or ask spectators to sign waivers. Category 1 Category 1 classification is for drones that weigh less than 0.55 lbs and have rotor protection, such as prop guards. These are assumed to have minimal safety risk for operations over people and moving vehicles, and as such, they are allowed to operate in transit over people. This means that the drone can pass over other people, but may not hover over them. If the drone is equipped with Remote ID, then the drone may hover over people, or open air assemblies of people. Starting in September 2023, all drones that do not have Remote ID will be restricted to special zones known as FAA Recognized Identification Areas. Category 2 Category 2 classification is for drones that have been granted a certificate that they will not cause a severe injury and include rotor protection, such as prop guards. The FAA provides a list of all models of drones that are certified for Category 2 operations. Similarly to Category 1, these are assumed to have safety risk for operations over people and moving vehicles, and as such, they are allowed to operate in transit over people. This means that the drone can pass over other people, but may not hover over them. If the drone is equipped with Remote ID, then the drone may hover over people, or open air assemblies of people. Starting in September 2023, all drones that do not have Remote ID will be restricted to special zones known as FAA Recognized Identification Areas. Category 3 Category 3 classification is for drones that have been granted a certificate that they will not cause a fatal injury and include rotor protection, such as prop guards. The FAA provides a list of all models of drones that are certified for Category 2 operations. Category 3 is the highest level of allowable risk and are restricted to only in transit flights over people with or without Remote ID. Flying over open air assemblies of people is prohibited unless the drone is equiped with Remote ID and the all persons the drone is flying over has consented. Category 4 Category 4 classification is a special authorization case for drones that have obtained a Part 21 Airworthiness Certification. The airworthiness certificate will specify the requirements and restrictions for operations over people.

The FAAs jurisdiction is the sky and aviation support (licensing, registration, infrastructure). However, there are other aspects of UAS activity that may be subject to local rules and regulations. State and local powers include Land Use Trespass Privacy Noise ordinances Wildlife conservation Insurance It is allowed for a State, county or city to place restrictions on where and when drones may take off and land (land use jurisdiction), to define what constitutes invasion of privacy, or to require insurance to operate for or within a jurisdiction. It is your responsibility to The UC Center of Excellence will help assist you in identifying applicable local regulations, however you are responsible for ensuring your regulatory compliance with all local regulations. 9.2.1 Searching for Local UAS Regulations There is no easy database for applicable UAS regulations - you will likely have to search multiple locations. Most county and state owned land that is set aside for conservation often have established processes for research permits that are good starting points for UAS use. Some good resources: The Drone Map of California lists all of the City and County drone regulations in California State level regulations are typically associated with state managed lands, wildlife conservation, privacy and insurance. County and Municipal Codes often include regulations for city/county parks and open spaces, typically on land use, trespass and privacy. Directors or on-site managers are often good people to ask for permit processes and costs 9.2.2 No Drone Zones Please respect local ordinances, even if you do not agree with them. Do not look for ways to circumvent or utilize a loophole if it is counter to the local communities desires. If you are operating for research or education, you are acting as a representative of the University of California, and we strive to be good neighbors and collaborative with all communities. Figure 9.3: No Drone Zone Sign If you feel strongly, engage the local community in outreach and discussion and work to change their views.
