Feel free to reach out to us at UASSafety@ucmerced.edu if you have any questions or would like to see additional resources added. UC Drone Policy There is a University of California Drone Policy that governs the use of drones owned by the University of California, the use of drones at any University property, or the use of drones for any University purpose (including teaching, outreach and research). More information about the UC UAS Policy can be found in the UC UAS Policy Guidance Document located at http://UCDrones.github.io/Policy_Guidance/ Policy Requirements The Policy establishes that anyone who seeks to operate a UAS under the jurisdiction of the policy must: Comply with any applicable regulation, including but not limited to any applicable FAA regulation. Have prior approval from the Campus Drone Person or the Systemwide Designated Authority. Operate in a manner that ensures public safety, right to privacy, civil rights and civil liberties. Maintain sufficient liability insurance coverage. The UC Center of Excellence on UAS Safety is here to help you guide you through the process.

["ch-register.html", "Chapter 1 Register your Drone 1.1 Create an account at DroneZone 1.2 Drone Registration 1.3 Registration Certificate 1.4 Marking the Drone", " Chapter 1 Register your Drone This page is for the registration of your drone with the Federal Aviation Administration. For information on how to register your drone with the UC system, see Chapter. All drones that weigh more than 0.55 lbs (250 grams) must be registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to it’s legal owner. Any drone purchased through the University of California for university business, including teaching and research, is owned by the Regents of the University of California. You can register the drone through the FAA Drone Zone (https://faadronezone.faa.gov). Registration costs only $5 per aircraft and only takes a couple of minutes. 1.1 Create an account at DroneZone Head to the FAA DroneZone (https://faadronezone.faa.gov) and select “I fly under Part 107 or as a Public Aircraft” 1.1 Figure 1.1: FAA DroneZone Unfortunately, the FAA’s drone registration website does not allow you to register drones for multiple groups or organizations. If you’re registering a drone on behalf of the University of California, you should use your UC email address as your account log in, and use a personal email address account for any personally-owned drones. When you enter your Part 107 Account information, enter Regents of the University of California as your Part 107 Account Name to correctly register the drone to the UC system. 1.2 Drone Registration Once you have an account, on the dashboard will be an option to ‘Manage sUAS Inventory.’ On that page, you’ll be able to ‘Add UAS’ (in the upper right corner). This will bring up a dialog box (Figure 1.2) for you to enter your information. Enter all the relevant information. Figure 1.2: Add new UAS Dialog Box Once completed, ‘Your Shopping Cart’ will now show this drone’s information and a new buttom for ‘Checkout’ will appear. Click the button and the system will guide you through paying for the registration fee. 1.3 Registration Certificate Upon completion of paying for registration, the DroneZone will send you two emails, one with a receipt of payment and the other is a pdf copy of your UAS registration certificate (Figure 1.3). Keep a copy of this registration certificate available at all times while you operate. This can be done by either printing it out and placing it with your drone, or keeping a digital copy on your phone. Figure 1.3: Example UAS Registration Certificate 1.4 Marking the Drone Your drone’s registration number is the 10 digit alphanumeric code that starts with FA. You must mark this on your drone on an external location, where it can be plainly visible. We recommend either using a permanent oil-based fine tip paint marker (Figure 1.4) or creating a label that can be strongly affixed to the drone. We’ve found that regular sharpies or markers are rubbed off too easily to be effective. Figure 1.4: Oil-Based Paint Markers If you’ll be working with a fleet of aircraft, it may also be useful to mark the ‘nickname’ of the drone as well. "],
["ch-license.html", "Chapter 2 Do I need an FAA License? 2.1 What is the difference? 2.2 When are you Exempt from a drone license 2.3 What are the stipulations for ‘Recreational’ and approved ‘Academic’ activities? 2.4 Other Situations 2.5 Frequently Asked Questions", " Chapter 2 Do I need an FAA License? When operating a drone within the US, there are two different options for regulations: Part 107 Small UAS regulations or the Exception for Limited Recreational Use. By default, UAS operations fall under Part 107 Small UAS regulations, unless you can meet the requirements for the exception for Recreational Use. Part 107 requires that all pilots have a Remote Pilot Certificate with an sUAS rating, more commonly known as a ‘Drone License,’ whereas Recreational Use does not require a Drone License. Many researchers opt to get a Drone License for their research needs, but a Drone License does cost $150 and will take some time to study and prepare for. With the updates introduced in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254), there are more exceptions available in which you may not need to obtain the license. This page is for the Federal Aviation Administration licensing requirements for UAS use. UC Policy will still require a flight request and post flight reporting, regardless of FAA licensing requirements. More information on the UC policy can be found in Chapter . 2.1 What is the difference? Under Part 107 Drone License required Any purpose ‘Fly only when it is safe’ May request special permissions Above FAA Facility Map altitudes Over People, BVLOS, More than 1 drone at a time Under Recreational Exception No license required Recreation or Approved Academic Activities ‘Fly only in safe locations’ No allowances for advanced operations 2.2 When are you Exempt from a drone license You may not need a drone license if your flight operations can fit under the stipulations listed for ‘recreational’ activities and your flight operations are related to Coursework Instruction of students Academic or research related uses of unmanned aircraft systems that have been approved by the institution Activities undertaken by the institution as part of research projects Other academic activities approved by the institution 2.3 What are the stipulations for ‘Recreational’ and approved ‘Academic’ activities? Recreational flight operations, despite what you see on YouTube, have strict requirements: Only fly below 400 ft Must stay within Visual Line of Sight Must fly only in safe areas and no closer than 25 ft to any individuals Must use an established safety line to separate all operations from spectators and bystanders Must get FAA authorization to fly in Controlled Airspace (Class B, Class C, Class D and surface Class E) Never fly over any person or moving vehicle Never interfere with any manned aircraft or emergency response activity Never fly under the influence of drugs or alcohol Never operate in a careless or reckless manner This is in addition to existing UAS operating restrictions under 14 CFR 107: No operating from a moving vehicle No operating more than one vehicle at a time No operating faster than 100 mph No operating when the weather visibility is less than 3 miles No operating closer than 500 ft below a cloud, or within 2000 ft horizontally from a cloud or fog layer 2.4 Other Situations There are other conditions that may require a closer evaluation, including whether you’re a US citizen or if you plan on flying internationally. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to UASsafety@ucmerced.edu for a consultation. Other scenarios that may require a closer look Performing a demonstration Not a US citizen Flying above 400 ft AGL Flying in fog or with limited visibility Flying at night Flying internationally 2.5 Frequently Asked Questions When doing an academic activity, which set of regulations is better? There are advantages and disadvantages to both scenarios. In many cases, the new ‘Recreational Operations’ may be the fastest path forward for simple, rural flight operations. At the current time, academic UAS activities that plan on flying in certain controlled airspace areas, over occupied structures, within 25 ft of another person, or outside of a reasonably controlled flying site, should proceed with 14 CFR 107 regulations. What does it mean to get approval from the FAA to operate within controlled airspace? The FAA is mandating that all controlled airspace access requests for recreational operations be routed through the Low Altitude Authorization Notification Capability system (LAANC) and not by calling the local airport tower. The LAANC system can provide instantaneous authorization via a 3rd party application such as Airmap, KittyHawk, or UASideKick for flight requests below a certain altitude depending on your location. I am planning to fly over a research site that is access controlled and the airspace is uncontrolled, do I need a Drone License? Typically not. This common scenario will typically meet the necessary site requirements for Recreational Operations. I am planning to fly along the beach to monitor coastal erosion, do I need a Drone License? Unless the beach is to be closed to the public, this scenario will likely require a Drone License. I am planning on flying in the campus quad to test a flight controller, do I need a Drone License? If the airspace is uncontrolled (Class G), and the area within the campus quad is sufficiently cleared and closed to non-participants, then you do not need a Drone License. If you want to fly on campus at UCI, UCLA or UCSB, then you will need to obtain an Airspace Authorization via LAANC. I do not have a Drone License, can I do a coursework assignment on the use of drones in building inspections? You may be able to do some flying without a drone license, however, you will not be allowed to fly over a building and must stay at least 25 ft from all non-participants, which may limit your ability to conduct effective analysis. I am a graduate student Teaching Assistant and I would like to teach my students how to fly a drone? Do I need a license? Do the students need a license? If the site is sufficiently cleared and closed to non-participants, than everyone may have a chance to learn how to fly a drone without a drone license and any instructor will also not need to have a license. However, additional safety precautions may be necessary and as an instructor, you will be responsible for ensuring the safety of the students and the site. "],
["ch-get-license.html", "Chapter 3 How to get a License 3.1 Drone License Exam 3.2 Free study resources 3.3 Drone License Eligibility", " Chapter 3 How to get a License Obtaining a Remote Pilot Certificate, or more commmonly known as a drone license, is relatively straight-forward 3.1 Drone License Exam The drone license exam (airman knowledge test) is a 120 minute, 60 question exam that goes over a wide range of topics. The topics covered on the exam can be broken down into 12 sections as follows: General UAS regulations Airspace classifications Aviation weather sources Loading and Performance Emergency procedures Crew resource management Radio communication procedures Determining UAS performance Physiological effects of drugs and alcohol Aeronautical decision-making and judgment Airport operations and Maintenance and pre-flight inspection procedures. A more in depth look at these topics can be found on the FAA’s website here: (https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/remote_pilot_study_guide.pdf) Although there are third party “Ground school” courses offered for a fee we have found freely available resources to be just as effective. 3.2 Free study resources Here are a few free study resources to aid in studying for the exam: (https://jrupprechtlaw.com/part-107-test-study-guide) (https://northrup.photo/free-faa-part-107-suas-drone-certification-study-guide/) (https://www.3dr.com/docs/faa-part-107-study-guide/part-107-certification-official-study-resources/) 3.3 Drone License Eligibility In order to be eligible to obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate, you must meet the following requirements: Be at least 16 years of age Be able to read, speak and understand the English language. If the applicant is unable to meet one of these requirements due to medical reasons, the FAA may place such operation limitations on that applicant’s certificate as are necessary for the safe operation of the small unmanned aircraft. Not know or have reason to know that he or she has a physical or mental condition that would interfere with the safe operation of a small unmanned aircraft system. However, to take the FAA Airman Knowledge Exam, the proponent must prove their identity with a valid photo ID that includes their date of birth, signature and physical, residential address. For U.S. Citizens and U.S. Resident Aliens, this may be accomplished with one of the following: Driver Permit or License issued by a U.S. state or territory U.S. Government Identification Card U.S. Military Identification Card Passport Alien Residency Card For Non-U.S. Citizens, this may be accomplished with one of the following: Passport and a Driver permit or license issued by a U.S. state or territory.

["ch-airspace-info.html", "Chapter 4 How to get Airspace information 4.1 Airmap 4.2 Official FAA Sources 4.3 Other Sources", " Chapter 4 How to get Airspace information When your figuring out where you want to fly, you’re typically thinking about your research objectives on the ground. But you must also think about whether or not it will be safe to fly a drone in the airspace at that location. You won’t find this information on Google Maps though - you need to check the Airspace Maps or Aviation Charts. Reading an Airspace Map is not like reading Google Maps - you’ll rarely see roads or buildings marked - instead you’ll be presented with a whole new set of symbols and strange codes. But they’re all very important to convey a dense set of aviation information. Luckily with drones, you won’t have to worry about most of it, but there’s still some very important pieces of information you need to know. Things you should look for when reviewing Airspace Information Airspace Class Nearby Airports, including smaller ones and helipads Potential air traffic patterns Special Use Airspace - Military Operating Areas, Controlled Firing Ranges, National Security Areas, and Restricted Areas Flying altitude limits within certain zones or grids Temporary Flight Restrictions or special alerts So where can you find this information? We recommend two sources: Airmap (3rd party application and website) Official FAA Sources - VFR Sectional Charts, FAA Facility Maps, TFR/NOTAMs 4.1 Airmap The most comprehensive and easy to use Drone airspace map system is Airmap. Just type in your address or find your spot on the map, and see whats around you. Airmap is available as both a webpage (Figure 4.1) and as an app for iOS or Android (Figure 4.2). Once you find your flying spot on the map, you can evaluate many of the airspace issues you need to look for. For example, in Figure 4.1, the selected flying spot is within a grid box within the purple shaded region. The text box to the bottom left gives a brief explanation - the purple shaded region is MERCED CLASS E2 airspace - meaning that the location is located within the vicinity of the Merced Airport. Any drone flying within any purple of blue shaded region will require permission from the FAA. Class E2 is the least riskiest of the airport managed airspace (also known as controlled airspace), but still will have some airspace risk with occasional planes and helicopters flying above. Figure 4.1: Android Airmap Application For requesting permission to fly within a shaded region (controlled airspace), the FAA and the airports have drawn up grids within the shaded regions and labeled each one with a generally safe upper limit for flying. Within the highlighted grid in Figure 4.1, this limit is 200 ft. If you ask the FAA for permission to fly up to 200 ft, you will always be given approval. In general, the farther away you are from the runway, the higher the altitude you will be allowed to fly. But that’s not always the case - you’ll notice, there are a couple of grids that are marked with a 0 - and yes, that means that the generally safe flying altitude is 0 ft. Need to get FAA permission to fly in one of these areas, head over here What if you need to fly higher than the altitude listed? If you have a drone pilot license, you may ask the FAA for permission - but it is not guaranteed to be approved. Obtaining permission for flights above the listed altitude can be tricky, so we recommend reaching out to us at UASsafety@ucmerced.edu and we’ll be happy to walk you through the process. Reach out to us early - the FAA can take 5-10 days to grant approval so you want to start this process early. Airmap also does a good job of depicting other airspace issues, such as Special Use Airspace and National Security Areas - marked in red as in Figure 4.2. Selecting the AIRMAP Recommended Guidelines layer will also show all the helipads and minor airports that are not normally shown on an airspace map. This can be critically important - low flying helicopters and cropdusters that fly out of these unmarked airports are among the most pressing airspace concerns. Make sure you click on the ‘Layers’ Icon next to the Flight Advisories - this allows you to turn on/off different information. For most operations, we recommend selecting the following sets of information: FAA Part 107 Certified AIRMAP Recommend Guidelines Restricted and Special Use Airspace National Parks Public Use Limits NOAA Regulated Overflight Zones Fish and Wildlife Service Lands Use Limits Wilderness Areas Use Limits Figure 4.2: Android Airmap Application 4.1.1 The importance of up-to-date Airspace Information Having the most up-to-date airspace information on hand can make all the difference between having a safe flight and a risky one. One of the advantages of Airmap is that it will also display a number of Temporary Flight Restrictions and Notices to Airman. Especially in California, there are a number of these that we should always keep an eye on: Disneyland - Due to National Security Risks, the FAA has banned all aircraft from flying under 3000 ft within 3 miles of Disneyland. This essentially also bans all drones in the area as well. Major League Baseball, National Football League and Division 1 College Football Regular and Post-Season Games - Similarly to the Disneyland restriction, the FAA has banned all aircraft from flying under 3000 ft within 3 miles of any these games. The ban starts at 1 hour before the games begin to 1 hour after the game ends. Wildfire and other Natural Disasters - Whenever there is a major catastrophe, keep an eye out for Temporary Flight Restrictions. These will often be very large and prolonged to allow emergency services (firefighting aircraft, medical support, etc) to have priority in these areas. Never fly your drone in a manner that could interfere with emergency services - it is both a Federal offense and a State offense. US President and Vice-President Travel - The President (30 mile) and Vice-President (5 mile) travel with their own FAA flight restriction zones, similarly prohibiting all aircraft from flying under 3000 ft within their zones. As with most drone related rules and regulations, there are nuances and exceptions to TFRs and NOTAMs. If you have a pressing need to operate within a TFR, reach out to us at UASsafety@ucmerced.edu to discuss. 4.2 Official FAA Sources Using Airmap is one of the easiest methods for looking up most of the airspace issues. However, it’s not always the most detailed nor is it the official source of information. The official sources of information is spread across a handful of different sites: Official source of airspace information - FAA Sectional Charts Official source of altitude grid information - UAS Facility Maps Official source of TFR or NOTAMS - FNS NOTAM Search Always check multiple sources - you never know when one source omits an important piece of information. For example, Figure 4.3 is the default view of Orange County of the UAS Facility Maps, but its doesn’t depict one very critical flight restriction. 4.2.1 FAA Sectional Charts FAA sectional chart Getting information on a specific area’s airspace classification has never been easier. The FAA has region specific sectional charts located here. 4.2.2 UAS Facility Maps Figure 4.3: UAS Facility Map UAS Facility Maps show the maximum altitudes around airports where the FAA may authorize drone operations without additional safety analysis. Grids marked in Green are LAANC (Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability) enabled - More on that in LAANC Authorization. 4.2.3 NOTAM or Notice To Airman FAA NOTAM (Notice to Airman) A NOTAM or Notice to Airman, is a notice that pertains to the establishment, change or condition of any facility, service or procedure of a specific location. The information is not known far enough in advance to be publicized by any other means therefore ensuring there are no active NOTAMS in the area you will be flying in is essential to the safety of yourself and others. It is important to keep in mind that NOTAMS can be put up at a moments notice. 4.3 Other Sources Two other useful sources of information are Skyvector and the B4UFly App (iOS and Android). 4.3.1 SkyVector Figure 4.4: SkyVector - VFR Chart viewer with TFRs SkyVector is a manned aviation tool that allows users to view the FAA Sectional Charts (also known as VFR charts) as well as a wide range of other layers, including TFRs and IFR approaches. While most of the information will be overwhelming for the beginning drone pilot, the basic VFR charts are still a great resource. 4.3.2 B4UFly App The B4UFly app is the FAA’s first attempt at developing and publishing an app for drone pilots. It has much of the same information as Airmap, though it notably does not include the altitude limits from the UAS Facility Maps. Otherwise, it’s a great source of information. "],

["ch-fire-safety.html", "Chapter 8 Fire Safety 8.1 LiPo Battery Guidance 8.2 Planning for Fire Mitigation", " Chapter 8 Fire Safety While UAS accidents and incidents involving fire are rare, they are a valid and significant concern. With the majority of UC UAS usage on field sites and other rural locations, the potential for the accidental sparking of fire is a concern. A fire sparked by a UAS can spread quickly (Figure 8.1) and with California’s dry environment, can cause significant damage (Figure 8.2). Figure 8.1: Beginning of a fire from UAS accident at Richmond Field Station, UC Berkeley Figure 8.2: Post fire damage from UAS accident at Richmond Field Station, UC Berkeley 8.1 LiPo Battery Guidance The most common cause of UAS related fire is from misuse of LiPo batteries. Special care should be taken when charging, discharging or storing LiPo batteries. If the internal polymer cell of a LiPo battery is exposed to air, a violent chemical reaction starts that could explode, but more commonly releases significant amounts of smoke and heat that can ignite other fire fuel sources. A LiPo battery fire is typically caused by a physical puncture to the battery or from misuse, such as overcharging or electrical shorts. Recommended Best Practices Always thoroughly inspect a battery before charging and use. Look for swelling, puffy cells, cracks in plastic, and charred debris along the contacts. Never use a battery that is not in good health. Consider batteries to be replaceable and consumable, rather than a permanent component of the UAS. Never store batteries in a hot car. Don’t charge your batteries unless you’re going to fly within the next day. After immediate use, place battery out of the sun but do not place within a closed container. Ensure there is sufficient airflow to allow the battery to cool. When done flying for the day, always charge your batteries at least back up to storage level. Do not charge an intelligent flight battery immediately after flight as the temperature may be too high. Wait until it cools down to room temperature before charging again. Store the battery in a dry and cool place, keep out of direct sunlight and away from any liquids Do not store or transport a battery with eyeglasses, watches, metal necklaces or other metal components that may short the battery When in transport, store the batteries in a safe container that will protect it from damage, squeezing, puncturing or falling. 8.2 Planning for Fire Mitigation In addition to LiPo battery care, special effort must be taken to consider the fire risks in UAS activity. Consult the appropriate department (Fire, Field Safety, EH&amp;S) if there are concerns over fire risk. Minimize the potential for fire by monitoring where the UAS will be flying and ensure that if a fire was to occur, the RPIC and any other persons, such as Visual Observers, are prepared to respond appropriately. Guidance for fire safety Everyone should take a fire safety training course. Avoid flying on high fire risk days, including Red Flag Warning alerts issued by CAL FIRE. Never fly alone in areas of moderate to high fire risk Always bring a fire extinguisher and a shovel/bucket of sand to field sites. During flight operations: Ensure that a crew member has easy access to fire equipment. Ensure that a crew member has easy access to reach any location where the UA may crash. Ensure that a crew member has the ability to report an emergency situation and can adequately provide directions for emergency personnel to reach the site. When flying in high fire risk locations, use high quality, commercially available UA with enclosed electronics. Never fly a damaged or swollen battery. "],

Within the UC system, we are obligated to follow all applicable regulations. So even if you see someone else fly in violation of the laws, it’s not ok for you to replicate it. 11.1 Visual Line of Sight Visual line of sight means that the pilot of the drone must be able to see the drone throughout the entire flight in order to know the drone’s location determine the drone’s attitude (orientation), altitude, and direction of flight observe the airspace for other air traffic or hazards determine that the drone does not endanger the life or property of another The pilot must be able to do the above at all times, but doesn’t have to be at all times - meaning he or she may glance at other objects, as long as the drone never leaves the pilot’s ability to resume looking at the drone at any time. At any given time, at least the pilot or any visual observers must maintain visual line of sight - meaning while the pilot is looking away, there must be a visual observer to watch the drone during that time. 11.1.1 A Speck in the Sky is not Sufficient At all times, your drone must be close enough that you can tell which direction the drone is facing, how high it is and whether there are any hazards. If all you can see of your drone is a small dot, it means you’ve gone too far. In practice, your visual distance may be significantly impaired by trees or buildings in the horizon that may make it difficult to see the drone. Common Drones and recommended max visual distance (on a clear day in a rural location) DJI Mavic Series 900 ft horizontal distance DJI Phantom Series 1200 ft horizontal distance DJI Matrice 600 Pro 3000 ft horizontal distance Fixed-wing (10ft wingspan) 5000 ft horizontal distance 11.1.2 You must be able to assess risk If you can’t see the sky around the drone or the ground below the drone as in Figure 11.1, you’re not within visual line of sight. Figure 11.1: Visual Line of Sight If this is a scenario that you’re looking to do, you may be able to deploy a helper to assist to maintaining a clear flight operational area. However, at no point is the drone allowed to be not viewable by the pilot. 11.2 Operations over Human Beings Your drone is not allowed to be flown directly over people (107.39), or in a manner that poses a hazard to other people in the event of a loss of control of the drone for any reason (107.19(c)). The combination of the two regulations form the majority of the restrictions around people. You may only fly above people who are part of the immediate flight crew and whose tasks include ensuring flight safety. It is not sufficient to provide spectators with personal protective equipment (PPE), or ask spectators to sign waivers. For more information about establishing effective safety buffers, see . "],

["ch-local-UAS-regulations.html", "Chapter 13 Local UAS Regulations 13.1 Searching for Local UAS Regulations 13.2 No Drone Zones", " Chapter 13 Local UAS Regulations Any regulatory agency or private property owner can make rules and regulations within their jurisdiction (within reason). The FAA’s jurisdiction is the sky and aviation support (licensing, registration, infrastructure). However, there are other aspects of UAS activity that may be subject to local rules and regulations. State and local powers include Land Use Trespass Privacy Noise ordinances Wildlife conservation Insurance It is allowed for a State, county or city to place restrictions on where and when drones may take off and land (land use jurisdiction), to define what constitutes invasion of privacy, or to require insurance to operate for or within a jurisdiction. It is your responsibility to The UC Center of Excellence will help assist you in identifying applicable local regulations, however you are responsible for ensuring your regulatory compliance with all local regulations. 13.1 Searching for Local UAS Regulations There is no easy database for applicable UAS regulations - you will likely have to search multiple locations. Most county and state owned land that is set aside for conservation often have established processes for research permits that are good starting points for UAS use. Some good resources: State level regulations are typically associated with state managed lands, wildlife conservation, privacy and insurance. County and Municipal Codes often include regulations for city/county parks and open spaces, typically on land use, trespass and privacy. Directors or on-site managers are often good people to ask for permit processes and costs 13.2 No Drone Zones Please respect local ordinances, even if you do not agree with them. Do not look for ways to circumvent or utilize a loophole if it is counter to the local communities desires. If you are operating for research or education, you are acting as a representative of the University of California, and we strive to be good neighbors and collaborative with all communities. Figure 13.1: No Drone Zone Sign If you feel strongly, engage the local community in outreach and discussion and work to change their views.
