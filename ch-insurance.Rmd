# Drone Insurance {#insurance}

Are you worried about crashing your drone?  While we take a lot of steps to help you fly safely, accidents can happen.  That's what insurance is for.

The UC provides comprehensive insurance coverage **free of charge** for drone operations.  This includes both liability insurance coverage and replacement insurance.

- **Liability insurance** will cover the costs of any damage caused by a drone to another person or property.  If your drone crashes and breaks a window, this is what liability insurance is for.
- **Physical Damage insurance** will cover the costs of replacing or repairing a damaged, destroyed or lost drone. Only available to UC-owned drones.
